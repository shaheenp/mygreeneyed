Other characteristics:
  - open branching pattern
  - leaves turn golden yellow in fall
  - often drop a major proportion of their fall foliage over a short period of time, sometimes a single night, creating a yellow carpet beneath a tree

Relevant info:
  - ancient tree used medicinally
  - 'Living fossil', sole survivor of an ancient group of trees that date back >200 million years ago (before dinosaurs)
  - only living bridge between 'higher' and 'lower' plants (i.e., ferns and conifers)
  - according to fossil record, ancient members of this genus typically occurred in riparian plant communities with *[Cercidiphyllum]({{ "/cercidiphyllaceae/cercidiphyllum" | relative_url }})* and *Metasequoia*
  - widely cultivated as an ornamental, probably for more than 3,000 years
  - certain varieties used as street trees
  - resistance to herbivory makes species popular in cities
  - nurseries typically sell only male trees (fruitless) because female trees produce seeds encased in fleshy, fruit-like coverings which, at maturity in autumn, are messy and emit a noxious, foul odor upon falling and splitting open
  - ginkgoic acid in the fleshy seed coat causes allergic contact dermatitis in humans
  - sacred to Buddhists and often planted near temples
  - endangered according to IUCN (on its Red List)

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to south-central and southeastern China, long cultivated
  - introduced to north-central China, South Korea and Japan
  - scattered in broadleaved forests, in moist, deep, sandy soils in full sunlight; in valleys on acidic, well-drained, yellow loess (pH = 5--5.5)
  - 300--1,100 (1,300) m.
  - complex phenology (timing) of sexual reproduction cycle may constrain the species’ ability to migrate, independently of humans, into cold-temperate regions with short growing seasons, and probably accounts for its limited, warm-temperate distribution as a wild or semi- wild tree in the mountains of central China
  - pollination by wind
  - sexual reproduction:
    - many aspects are influenced by temperature, which varies with latitude and elevation across species distribution; trees typically reach sexual maturity at 20 yrs
    - reproductive organs produced on short shoots in the axils of bud scales and leaves
    - catkins emerge before the leaves and fall off immediately after shedding their pollen
    - when the ovule is receptive, secretes a small droplet of mucilaginous fluid from a tiny opening, which captures airborne pollen
    - retraction of this droplet at the end of the day brings the pollen into the pollen chamber
    - once inside ovule, male gametophyte develops over 4 to 5 months, ultimattely with the production of a pair of multiflagellated spermatozoids, one of which fertilizes a waiting egg cell
  - seed dispersal:
    - consumption of fruits by wild cats (e.g., leopard cat, masked palm civet) in China aid in seed dispersal and germination (via exposure to acids of animal gut)
    - once seeds fall to the ground in the autumn and decay, fleshy seed coat exudes butanoic and hexanoic acids, which produce an unpleasant rancid-butter-like smell, probably mimicking the smell of carrion (dead animal flesh) to which the wild cats and other carnivores would be attracted
  - seed germination:
    - removal of fleshy seed coat appears to be necessary for seed germination
    - exposure to cold temperatures of winter appear to increase germination rates
  - vegetative reproduction -- sends up new shoots from roots, which contributes to longevity of the clone
  - herbivore/pathogen defense:
    - ginkgotoxin in the seeds is a neurotoxin that induces seizures in animals
    - leaves are resistant to many pathogens and herbivores because of the presence of toxic leaf compounds, such as terpenoids (ginkgolides, bilobalides), flavonoids, and ginkgotoxin
    - plant tissues that are attacked by herbivores also emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), that may induce defense on the same or different plants
    - bark contains tannins
