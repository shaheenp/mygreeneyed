*Pinus* -- pine genus

*nigra* -- black

Native range: Austria, N. Italy to the Balkans

Leaves:
  - 2 per fascicle
  - 4-6" long
  - stiff
  - dark green

Cones:
  - female cones yellowish-brown
  - ovoid
  - 2-3" long, 1.25" wide
  - keel (base of cone) differing in color

Other characteristics:
  - tree growing up to 150 ft.

Relevant info:
  - resistant to salt spray (e.g., used in road de-icing) and various industrial pollutants making this species a popular tree in urban settings

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - mountain elevations 820-5,910 ft. (250-1,800 m) in central and southern Europe
  - drought tolerance -- possibly through:
    - deeper roots
    - increasing root:shoot
    - changing xylem cell diameter
    - lignified tissue increase
    - water-absorbing tissue in needle decrease
  - snow/ice damage resistance -- freezing temp lowered with concentrations of soluble carbohydrates & the composition of fatty acids and alkanes in the needles; roots also resistant
  - seedlings > 2 months old contain compounds that make them unpalatable to herbivores/browsers
