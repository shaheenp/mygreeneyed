Leaves:
  - needles (linear)
  - flat
  - radially spreading, turn up on twig
  - most needles under 1.5" and tightly spaced on twig
  - grayish or blueish green
  - mostly straight
  - young twigs greenish
  - stomatal bands on both sides -- 1 on upper (3--6 rows at midrib), 2 lower
  - circular scar on twig when leaves fall

Cones:
  - female cones:
    - woody
    - upright
    - deciduous
    - purple
    - 2--4" long
    - takes two years (growing seasons) to develop
    - disintegrate on tree, leaving only central core
    - rare; spreading occurs primarily through layering
    - scale densely hairy

Other characteristics:
  - evergreen
  - <100' tall, 2' diameter
  - 'spire-like' crown (very tall and thin)

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - most widespread fir in North America
  - at subalpine elevations (and stunted tree at highest elevations) but also near sea level in cold-air drainages of major rivers (crowned by ice fields) that cut through Coast Range in SE Alaska/North Coast B.C.
  - west of Cascade Mountains, mostly found between 4,000 and 6,500 ft. (1,200--2,000 m.)
  - most abundant near timberline
  - at tree-line, commonly in krumholtz form (i.e., crooked, twisted as a result of exposure to fierce freezing winds)
  - in Cascades on eat and west slopes, and in eastern Olympic Mountains on dry sites
  - shade tolerance:
    - lower branches remain intact despite shading by higher branches
    - crown shape responds to light conditions, e.g., may become umbrella shaped, with shorter branches in lower light conditions created by neighboring trees
    - shade-adapted leaves are relatively thinner so that available sunlight (usually flecks) can reach the photosynthesizing chloroplasts
    - sun-adapted leaves have smaller but more stomata per area, which permits regulation of water and gas exchange
  - vegetative reproduction -- at highest elevations, spreading occurs primarily through layering (i.e., branches rooting when they touch ground), which creates an "apron" at the base of some trees
  - snow-adapted -- layering is adaptation to heavy snow, wind, and cold temperatures that restrict growth much above surface of the ground
  - sexual reproduction:
    - cones are rare
    - heavy winter snowfall shortens growing season and lowers soil temps to the point at which seedling establishment is difficult
    - individual trees reflect solar radiation, which creates a microclimate that is slightly warmer and where seedlings may establish
    - this microclimate results in clumping of trees
    - seeds overwinter under or in snow
    - cold, moist stratification is required for germination, but seeds remain viable for only a year
  - seed dispersal: seeds have "wings" to facilitate dispersal by wind, so may colonize burned sites (especially mineral soils) but are otherwise sensitive to fire
