Other characteristics:
  - several-stemmed shrub to small tree, 3--12 m. tall
  - young twigs covered with fine, short down, or minutely pubescent

Relevant info:
  - though tart, the fruits are an important food for most coastal indigenous peoples
    - eaten fresh or stored underwater, or in a mix of oil and water
    - the acidity of the fruit is its own preservative
    - fruits become sweeter with time
  - morphologically and phylogenetically closer to Asian species of apple than to eastern North American ones
  - in Oregon and Washington, wild crabapple hybridizes with the cultivated apple, *M. pumila* froming *M. x dawsoniana*
  - also known as *Pyrus fusca*, which refers to pears
    - perhaps *fusca* refers to "dark pear" and is less of a distinction when applied to apples

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native from Alaska south to California
  - in Washington, mainly west of the Cascade crest
  - found in moist woods, swamps, open canyons, edges of standing and flowing water, bogs, open Sitka spruce forests, forest edges and clearing, brackish marshes, upper beaches, often fringing estuaries & sea cliffs
  - sea level to moderate elevations in the mountains (0--600 m.)
  - pollinated by bees attracted to nectar and pollen
  - seed dispersal -- birds and other animals eat fruit and disperse seeds
  - herbivore defense:
    - bark contains cyanide-producing compounds that can cause cardiac arrest or paralysis in animals
    - cyanogenic compounds also defend against bacterial and fungal pathogens by interfering with cellular respiration
    - branches armed with sharp spur shoots
  - tolerant of occasional exposure to salt water probably by:
    - accumulating osmoticants (small molecules) to stimulate higher internal salt concentrations and prevent diffusion of salt ions
    - limiting water loss so that cellular salt concentrations don't increase
    - found at highest elevations in brackish marshes
