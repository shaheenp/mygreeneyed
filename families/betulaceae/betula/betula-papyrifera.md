Relevant info:
  - maximum height is reached at 60-70 yrs
  - rarely lives longer than 140 yrs
  - root sprouts, found in groves
  - native to Washington north of Everett
  - bark can be peeled off in large, flexible, waterproof sheets, which were used by native people inland from the NW Coast for canoes and baskets

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to Alaska to Oregon, east of the Cascades except in northwest Washington, east to the Atlantic coast
  - found in moist, open to dense woods, from lowlands to lower mountain slopes
  - typically on well-drained sites but also on or around bogs and other wetlands and alluvial (riverine) sites
  - sexual reproduction:
    - male catkins are partially formed in the fall, remain dormant in the winter, and expand to a length of about 4 inches (10 cm) before flowering in the spring
    - female catkins appear in the spring before the leaves are fully expanded.
  - pollination by wind
  - seed dispersal -- light, winged seeds are dispersed readily by wind
  - vegetative regeneration:
    - sprouts from stump base or root collar following cutting or fire
    - re-sprouting vigor diminishes with age of tree
  - adapted to wetlands:
    - lenticels (pores) in bark enable transfer of oxygen to roots in saturated soil
    - shallow root system increases access to oxygen
  - herbivore defense -- leaves contain condensed tannins that reduce digestibility of tissue by binding with proteins
  - succession -- shade-intolerant species rapidly colonizes open disturbed sites created by wildfire, windthrow, or avalanche but lasts only one generation (cannot self- replace) before it is replaced by shade-tolerant conifers or northern hardwoods
  - adapted to fire:
    - at the population level, recovers quickly by means of seedling establishment and vegetative regeneration
    - undamaged trees needed to re-colonize exposed mineral soils of burned areas
    - thin bark renders young trees susceptible to injury, though thick bark of older trees is more flammable once it begins to exfoliate
    - compared to conifer-dominated forest types, canopy has a high moisture content and the understory is lush so crown fires may stop at the boundary of large birch stands or become slow-moving ground fires
    - large paper birch trees often survive fire in pure stands, and thus become seed trees for post-fire establishment
  - wildlife -- deer and moose browse twigs in winter
