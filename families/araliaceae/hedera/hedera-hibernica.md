Fruit:
  - clusters of small yellow-green flowers are followed (by usually) black round berries
  - fruits in the spring
  - foliage of flowering shoots is often less deeply lobed than that of the sterile, climbing shoots

Relevant info:
  - HIGHLY INVASIVE in PNW
  - seeds spread by birds, then plant spreads vegetatively
  - many non-invasive cultivars available
  - the nomenclature is confusing...
    - four cultivars of English ivy have been shown to be most invasive in the Pacific Northwest and are Class C noxious weeds on the Washington State Noxious Weed List:
      - *Hedera helix* 'Baltica'
      - *H. helix* 'Pittsburgh'
      - *H. helix* 'Star'
      - *H. hibernica* 'Hibernica'
    - *H. hibernica* used to be classified as a subspecies of *H. helix*
    - it is also called Atlantic or Irish ivy but is very similar to English ivy and is generally called English ivy here
    - these invasive cultivars of ivy are on the non-regulated noxious weed list in King County
      - property owners are not required to control these species because it is well established in the region
    - much of what is invading here is called English ivy (*H. helix*) but is actually *H. hibernica*

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native in W. Europe, including British Isles, to Central Spain
  - sea level to 500+ m.
  - invasive in the PNW and must be managed in natural areas and restoration sites
  - evergreen and well-adapted to the mild Pacific Northwest climate, it grows all year round in western Washington and can out-compete many other plant species
  - very shade tolerant
  - vegetative reproduction -- spreads outward through its long vines that root at the nodes and climb over/around obstacles
  - sexual reproduction -- upon reaching maturity, it shifts to forming branches that produce berries
  - seed dispersal -- berries are distributed mostly by birds such as starlings, European house sparrows, band-tailed pigeons, robins and cedar waxwings, though berries are poisonous to some birds (i.e., have chemical herbivory defenses)
  - control:
    - physical removal of English ivy vines and roots is often the most effective method of control
    - older thicker plants require more effort to remove
    - ivy growing up tree trunks can be controlled by removing all the vines from the lower trunk of the tree
    - ivy should be cleared from around the base of the tree as well, and the area should be mulched to resist re-invasion by ivy and other weeds
    - spraying young leaves with a systemic herbicide when the plant is actively growing is effective
