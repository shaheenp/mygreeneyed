*Syringa* -- from the Greek *syrinx*, meaning tube or pipe in reference to the pith-filled but easily hollowed stems of some plants in this genus (same root as the English word 'syringe')

Other notes:
  - stems were once used for pipes
  - in the same vein, Syrax was a nymph from Greek mythology who was metamorphosed into a hollow willow reed in order to escape the amorous advances of Pan, god of the fields and forests, in further reference to the hollow stems of some plants in the genus
