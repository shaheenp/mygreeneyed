  - not commonly seen

Other notes:
  - perennials 0.5-1.5 ft.
  - evergreen or deciduous ground-cover

  - genus name is of unclear origin and meaning
  - *pinnatus* -- Latin for feathered in probably reference to leaf shape

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - example in the WA Arboretum: *E. pinnatum ssp. colchicum* 'Thunderbolt'
    - Native to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkey
    - found in the woodland areas of the Caucasus Mtns near the Black Sea and Caspian Sea
  - very shade tolerant:
    - thin leaves create largest light-absorbing area possible with minimal investment in leaf tissue
    - leaves oriented horizontally to capture light
    - evergreen leaves permit photosynthesizing before canopy leaves emerge overhead.
  - drought tolerant
    - in *E. pubescens*, relative water content decreases slightly but is otherwise maintained above 70%
    - membrane degradation is prevented via the production of cell defense enzymes
  - Vegetative reproduction via rhizomes forms clumps
  - pollination by bees Compounds (glycosides, etc.) prevent microbial infection and help defend against herbivory
