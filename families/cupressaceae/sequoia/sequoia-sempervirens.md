Ecology & Adaptations:
  - SW Oregon and NW California, confined to coastal areas (within 60 km of the sea) experiencing a great deal of fog
  - at elevations generally below 300 m, occasionally to 1000 m.
  - mostly found in alluvial fans, coastal plains, and benches along large streams
  - grows in alluvial soils (unconsolidated soils consisting of material eroded by water and deposited downstream or down-elevation), where it forms pure stands or occurs with *[Pseudotsuga menziesii]({{ "/pinaceae/pseudotsuga/pseudotsuga-menziesii/" | relative_url }})*, *[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana](../../chamaecyparis/chamaecyparis-lawsoniana/)*, or other local conifers
  - evergreen leaves allow photosynthesis year-round, and conical shape maximizes light absorption throughout the day and all seasons
  - vegetative reproduction:
    - from stump sprouts or layering, so young trees receive nutrients, water and carbohydrates from “parent” trees and thereby gain a competitive advantage over other species, even in the deep shade of older trees
    - results in clumps of clonal stems growing in close proximity
  - pollination by wind
  - very shade tolerant:
    - high photosynthetic capacity at low light levels
    - able to self-replace within forest stands
  - tolerates sedimentation -- in a floodplain environment where sediment deposition of up to 75 cm can occur, develops new and higher lateral root system from buried buds on trunk
  - “Fog water” capture:
    - water in air condenses on leaves and drips to the ground, where the roots can absorb it
    - extra water may explain why the trees can grow so big
  - fire resistant & wind resilient:
    - thick bark protects living vascular tissue
    - great height also helps tree “escape” fires of low and moderate intensity
    - trunk re-sprouts from stumps following fire
    - epicormic buds (dormant beneath bark until higher branch is destroyed) enable the tree to produce new branches after destruction by fire or windstorm
  - herbivore & pathogen defense – compounds (terpines and sabinene) in leaves and wood deter herbivores and protect against fungal infection
  - canopy community:
    - multiple trunks that form 60 m above the ground provide structure for complex plant/animal/microbial interactions
    - these mini ecosystems provide habitat for mammals, birds, amphibians and arthropods
  - nutrient absorption –- mycorrhizal association aids nutrient and water uptake in forest environments with a lot of competition for resources
