Relevant info:
  - birds like fruit
  - common in the English countryside as a roadside hedge
  - *C. monogyna* was introduced early to North America to be used for agricultural hedges, a practice now discontinued on this continent
  - naturalized in the PNW
  - other *Crataegus* spp. have pink flowers
  - *C. douglasii* is native to PNW

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to forest understories of Europe, northern Africa, western Asia
  - naturalized in the PNW and invasive in local urban forests, riparian areas, abandoned fields and pastures, shrub lands and grasslands, and oak woodlands
  - occurring chiefly west of the Cascades crest in Washington, less common in southeast corner of the State
  - Alaska south to California, in other scattered locations in western North America, and widely distributed in eastern North America
  - invasive in local urban forests prolific seed producer and can form dense thickets which exclude all understory plants
  - can hybridize with native hawthorn species such as the black hawthorn (*C. douglasii*) found in the west
  - seed dispersal -- produces abundant red berries are attractive to robins and possibly other birds and animals, which help spread this tree far beyond where it is planted.
  - disease resistance -- compounds in its tissues render the species resistant to many diseases of *Crataegus*, e.g. rust.
  - control:
    - not regulated but recommended in natural areas that are being restored to native vegetation and in protected forest lands and wilderness areas
    - seedlings and young saplings can be pulled or dug up when soil is moist, but roots quickly become deep and stout, and sharp thorns are present even on young seedlings
    - mature trees have deep and extensive roots so digging is labor-intensive and results in considerable soil disturbance if all of the roots are removed
    - often sprouts from stump, so removal by cutting alone is not usually effective
    - applying herbicide with the cut stump or frilling method is most effective approach for plants that cannot be removed by digging or grubbing out the roots
