Other characteristics:
  - shrub to 2 ft.
  - rhizomatous
  - bark is bright yellow inside (due to the alkaloid berberine)
  - shredded bark of stems and roots was used by First Nations weavers to make a bright yellow dye for basket materials

Relevent info:
  - often found in shade
  - genus name has gone back and forth between *Mahonia* and *Berberis* for years, so be aware of both and use either

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to both sides of the Cascades in Washington, southern British Columbia to California, also in northern Idaho
  - habitat:
    - dry to fairly moist
    - open to closed forests
    - sea level to moderate elevations in the mountains
  - tolerant of low nutrient substrates, such as coarse, shallow rocky soils, coarse alluvium, or glacial outwash
  - evergreen leaves maximize function of investment in photosynthesizing structures
  - shade tolerant
  - drought tolerant:
    - thick leaves retain moisture
    - short vasicentric tracheids occur next to vessels throughout a growth ring, not in a longitudinal row, and can provide a subsidiary conducting system and maintain water columns (and conduction) to leaves when other tissues fail during drought
  - vegetative reproduction:
    - Spreads through rhizomes
    - after fire or other disturbance, re-sprouts vigorously from rhizomes or rootstocks
  - pollination by insects, including moths
  - seed dispersal by animals that consume fruit
  - herbivory protection -- spines on leaf margins
  - wildlife:
    - leaves are eaten especially in winter by elk and voles
    - fruits are eaten by small birds and mammals and sometimes black-tailed deer
    - nectar is favored by Anna's hummingbird
