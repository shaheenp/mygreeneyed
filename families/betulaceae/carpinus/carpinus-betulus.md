Leaves:
  - alternate
  - simple
  - ovate-oblong
  - 2--3 (5) inches (5--8[13] cm) long
  - acute tip
  - base rounded or subcordate
  - conspicuously ribbed
  - parallel, prominent, impressed veins (10--13 pairs)
  - doubly serrate margin
  - turning yellow in autumn
  - brown leaves which stay attached, dropping only in spring when the new green leaves are starting to come out
  - similar to those of the beech (*[Fagus sylvatica]({{ "/fagaceae/fagus/fagus-sylvatica/" | relative_url }})*), but less shiny

Other characteristics:
  - tree 40--60 (70) ft.
  - many upright branches, rounded canopy
  - many branches occur low and in semi-whorled fashion on the trunk
  - smooth grey bark
  - trunk sometimes having a rippled muscular character to its surface contours ("musclewood" is a common name in Britain)

Relevant info:
  - popular street tree, also used in parks and gardens
  - common name, hornbeam, comes from the extremely hard wood of this tree that will take a horn-like polish and was once used in Europe to make yokes for oxen (the beam between the ox horns)
  - also called ironwood due to very hard wood


Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native from Europe to Iran, including Turkey and Ukraine from sea level to 700 m. in Central Europe, 1000 m in the Western Alps, and 1800 m. in Iran
  - found in lowlands, hills and the low mountain belt in temperate climates
  - high summer temperatures limit its distribution in the south
  - deep moist and well-drained soils from sub-acid to calcareous, although can tolerate wet heavy clay to light dry sandy soils
  - component of classic European temperate forest on fertile soils, as well as beech (*[Fagus sylvatica]({{ "/fagaceae/fagus/fagus-sylvatica/" | relative_url }})*) forests
  - pollinated by wind
  - vegetative regeneration/reproduction - sprouts (suckers) from roots and epicormic buds in trunk
  - herbivore/microbial defense -- compounds (such as phenolic acids, flavonoid glycosides, tannins, and procyanidins) affect palatability, interfere with digestion, affect respiration of herbivores, and provide protection from microbial infection
  - very shade tolerant:
    - morphological modifications in response to low light include thinner leaves in shaded vs. full-sun conditions, which minimizes investment per unit area in photosynthesizing structure
    - physiological modifications include lower photosynthetic capacity in shade leaves, based on both area and mass
  - succession -- can colonize open sites as well as be part of the understory
