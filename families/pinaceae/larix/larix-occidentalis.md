Cones:
  - monoecious
  - male cones:
    - small
    - oblong
    - solitary and terminal
    - often yellow
    - many spirally arranged anthers
    - stalked or sessile
  - female cones:
    - subglobose
    - solitary
    - rounded scales
    - persistent scales
    - new cones are often red/purple or green
    - long-winged seeds
      - distributed generally within 328 ft. (100 m.) of the parent, though some travel much further

Other characteristics:
  - trees up to 210 ft.
  - pyramidal form when young
  - bark in mature trees is thick and furrowed into large, flaky or scaly plates
  - fall color is yellow to orange
  - short shoots resemble *[Cedrus](../../cedrus/)* but is deciduous, so leaves are soft

Relevant info:
  - may live up to 900 years
  - *L. lyallii* -- NW native
  - *L. decidua* -- common ornamental species
  - important timber-producing species in W. North America
    - densest wood of the northwestern conifers
    - durable and decay-resistant

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to region east of the Cascades, southeastern British Columbia to Oregon, east to Montana and Alberta
  - found in alpine and subalpine forests, mountain valleys and lower slopes, often in swampy areas
  - occupies relatively cool, moist climatic zones
  - upper elevational range is limited by low temperatures, while the lower extreme is limited by low precipitation.
  - long-lived early successional species -- grows rapidly in disturbed environments and maintains dominance over other species
  - efficient light capture:
    - leaf configuration maximizes light availability and limits self-shading within the canopy
    - lower cost of producing leaves than associated conifers, which incorporate lignin and compounds used for herbivory defense
  - pollinated by wind
  - fire-resistance:
    - most resistant species in its range
    - needles are less flammable than other species' due to their small size and high water content (due to being less than 5 months old)
    - since tree replaces its needles annually anyway, it is better adapted to defoliation than other conifers
    - after defoliation early in the season western larch trees often will produce a 2nd set of needles from heat-resistant woody buds and epicormic branches
    - small needles also minimize accumulation of surface litter at tree bases that would serve as fuel for fire
    - seeds are very light and long- winged, and can reach, germinate and grow readily on recently burned soils
    - sapwood (xylem) has greater water storage capacity than other conifers of comparable diameter
  - low nutrient conditions:
    - adapted to medium and coarse textured soils, which tend to be low in nutrients
    - leaf nitrogen content and leaf area indicate high photosynthetic capacity in comparison with associated conifers
    - uses nitrogen efficiently during the growing season and reabsorbs nitrogen from leaves at the end of the growing season
    - uses nitrogen more efficiently than evergreen trees
  - herbivory, insect & pathogen defense:
    - volatile compounds in oleoresin (pitch) interfere with insect larvae production and protect against some pathogens
    - many insects and diseases can affect western larch, but damage is usually less severe than in associated species
    - deciduous habit helps with resistance to pests
    - if trees are defoliated, they produce a 2nd set of needles later in the season
    - epicormic branching (from inactive buds under the bark that become active) appears to offer protection against disease by replacing older, potentially infected branches
  - wildlife:
    - provides habitat for variety of species:
      - pileated woodpeckers, a sensitive species, are dependent on old-growth western larch forests and forage for insects
      - though generally unpalatable to deer, elk, etc., may be eaten as emergency food
      - seeds are palatable to small birds and mammals
      - several species of grouse rely on large needles
      - flying squirrels, woodpeckers, owls, and various songbirds nest in rotting western larch cavities
