Leaves:
  - alternate
  - simple
  - elliptic to oval
  - base of blade flat or somewhat heart-shaped
  - leaf margins doubly serrate
  - 1.5--4.5" long
  - 1--3" wide
  - very soft densely pubescent leaves
  - turn yellow in fall

Flowers:
  - monoecious
  - catkins:
    - males
    - 1" long
    - emerge before the appearance of leaves
  - female flowers:
    - enclosed in bracts at the tip of the twigs
    - only the red stigmas visible
    - emerge after males

Fruit:
  - spherical
  - edible, beaked nut (hazelnut)
  - surrounded by husk (involucre, or cluster of bracts):
    - originating at the nut base
    - light-green, covered with stiff prickly hairs
    - projecting 1--1.5" beyond the nut into a "beak"
  - clusters of 2 or 3 at ends of branches

Other characteristics:
  - deciduous
  - many stems radiating from single root crown
  - 4--8' wide, up to 15'
  - ~ bristly-hairy (long white hairs) on young twigs
  - slender new growth creates a “zigzag” pattern at end of branch

Relevant info:
  - important food for NW tribes (picked in early autumn, stored until ripe, eaten fresh or roasted)
    - used them for trading, for instance with the Lewis and Clark Expedition and with plant explorer David Douglas
  - in some areas, productivity of shrub is enhanced by burning
  - in Oregon's Willamette Valley, there are 30,000 acres of commercially grown European Hazelnut or Filbert (*C. avellana*) and the nuts are often distributed by birds to natural area
    - the resulting shrubs are sometimes confused with the native hazelnut
  - used in hazelnut breeding programs to produce high-yield, disease-resistant hybrid cultivars (for instance, resistance to eastern filbert flight fungus)
  - the variety native to the Pacific Northwest and West Coast is *C. cornuta* var. *californica*
    - indicator species for low-elevation, warm sites with well-drained soils in western Oregon and southwestern Washington
  - eastern variety (var. *cornuta*) is rhizomatous and often considered "weedy"

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - widespread in North America from British Columbia to Newfoundland, south to California, Colorado, Missouri, Ohio, and Georgia
  - in WA, on both sides of the Cascades, and in the SW and NE portions (cooler elevations) of the eastern side of the state
  - found in moist but well-drained sites, forest edge and shady openings, thickets, clearings, in coves and canyons, rocky slopes and well-drained streamside habitats
  - at low to middle elevations (100--500 m)
  - wind pollinated
  - seed dispersal:
    - occurs via birds and rodents that cache seeds, such as Steller's jays and scrub jays and red squirrels and least chipmunks
    - greater than 66% of scatter-hoarded nuts were consumed or relocated by the rodents
    - however, remaining cached nuts were protected by litter and/or soil and had a better chance of germinating and establishing than uncached nuts
    - Douglas's squirrels, and golden-mantled ground squirrels also consume seeds
    - especially important to squirrels and other acorn-eating animals in times of oak (*[Quercus]({{ "/fagaceae/quercus/" | relative_url }})* spp.) acorn crop failure
  - vegetative reproduction:
    - spreads widely by suckers (new stems from roots)
    - may also layer
    - *C. c.* var. *california* typically does not have rhizomes (unlike eastern variety)
  - fire tolerance:
    - via seed establishment on new (open) sites
    - also re-sprouts from root crown after top-kill by fire
  - wildlife -- harvested shortly after ripening by squirrels and other cache-forming animals
  - herbivore/microbial defense:
    - hairy leaf texture reduces palatability
    - caffeic acid, gallic acid, and vanillic acid provide anti-fungal and anti-bacterial protection for the seed (nut)
  - moderately shade-tolerant, but abundance decreases with canopy closure and time since disturbance
