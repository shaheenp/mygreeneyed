Ecology & Adaptations:
  - grow in moist or swampy areas from sea level to mid-elevations in the mountains
  - shallow roots allow better access to O<sub>2</sub> in wet conditions
  - seedlings are tolerant of flooding
  - shade tolerant
  - vegetative reproduction by layering (re-rooting) of fallen/sweeping branches
  - conical shape maximizes light absorption throughout the day, year-round
  - defense:
    - resinous wood is poisonous to insects and resistant to bacterial and fungal infestation
    - secondary (aromatic) compounds in leaves provide protection from microbial infection and herbivory
