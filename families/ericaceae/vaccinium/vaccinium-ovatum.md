Other characteristics:
  - evergreen shrub to 12 ft. (0.5--4 m.)
  - branchlets reddish, young are pubescent (hairy)
  - in PNW, our only *[Vaccinium](../)* species with leathery, evergreen leaves, and flowers in racemes

Relevant info:
  - harvested for use in floral arrangements
  - in some areas, has been over-harvested/exploited according to Kruckeberg (UW botany prof)
  - can be planted as hedge plant or ground cover
  - according to [Great Plant Picks](https://www.greatplantpicks.org/plantlists/view/1611), one of the most versatile and underused native plants of the PNW
  - Native Americans valued this berry throughout its range, often traveling miles in order to collect them during seasonal rounds

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native from British Columbia south to California
  - in Washington, occurring west of the Cascades crest
  - found in coniferous forests (esp. edges and openings) at low elevations
  - often on the beach fringe in the salt spray zone, usually close to tidewater
  - also epiphytic on trunks of redwoods
  - near sea level to 300 ft. in Oregon, and to 3,000 feet (0--914 m.) in CA
  - vegetative regeneration:
    - sprouts from well-developed root crown structure after aboveground vegetation is damaged by fire, herbivory and mechanical damage
    - does not appear to produce rhizomes
  - pollinated by long-tongued bees such as bumblebees
  - seeds are widely dispersed by birds and mammals
  - herbivory/pathogen defense -- cinnamic acid derivatives and flavonol glycosides
  - shade tolerant but also grows in full sun
  - tolerates low nutrients:
    - require relatively small amounts of many essential elements and are capable of growing on many relatively infertile, nitrogen-poor soils
    - association with ericoid mycorrhizal fungus aids nutrient and water absorption
    - evergreen leaves conserve nutrients
  - drought tolerant:
    - though grows in moist climates, can tolerate drier conditions
    - leathery leaves retain moisture
    - mycorrhizae aid water uptake
  - wildlife:
    - important browse for elk in some areas
    - berries are eaten by many species of birds and mammals
    - important food source for grizzly and black bears
    - berries eaten by other small mammals such as chipmunks, red fox, squirrels, gray fox, and skunks
    - dense thickets may serve as hiding, resting, or nesting sites for many birds and mammals
