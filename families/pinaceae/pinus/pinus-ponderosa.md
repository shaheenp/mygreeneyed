Relevant info:
  - may live up to 600 years without fire, but in landscapes characterized by fire intervals of <20 years
  - important timber tree
  - most far-ranging *[Pinus](../)* in W. North America with many subspecies
  - before fire-suppression practices, fire maintained Ponderosa pine as a dominant species throughout its range
  - state tree of Montana

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to east of the Cascades, British Columbia to Baja California, east to the Dakotas and Texas
  - mostly inland but in a few localities in the Puget Trough, Washington, and the Willamette Valley Oregon
  - found in mostly dry areas in open forests at low to moderate elevations
  - pollinated by wind, though some self-pollination occurs
  - seed dispersal by wind and animals
  - winged seeds are buoyant and travel short distances
  - birds and mammals disperse seeds, often farther than wind carried them
  - seeds buried in caches by rodents (such as yellow-pine chipmunks and golden-mantled ground squirrels) or Clark’s nutcrackers have a better chance of establishing than seeds dispersed to the forest floor by wind
  - seedling establishment:
    - viable seeds stratify naturally over winter and germinate the following spring
    - few seeds actually establish
    - for those that do, growth is most favorable on open sites with light shade
  - no vegetative reproduction
  - fire adapted:
    - thick, flakey bark
    - few low branches that can catch fire in low- or moderate-intensity fires
    - seedlings establish from seeds in remaining crown cones or blown in from off site or carried in by animals
    - initial allocation of growth to taproot, rather than stems and needles, aids post-fire regeneration because long taproots allow seedling to access soil moisture in lower soil profiles even on blackened and hot, burned-over soils
  - herbivore/microbial defense -- compounds (including phenolics, flavonoids, terpenes and tannins) deter herbivory and protect against microbial infection
  - insect defense:
    - this species is susceptible to bark beetle attacks, especially in association with fire damage or drought stress
    - fire induces resin duct formation, and high resin flows and formation of new ducts increase resistance to beetle attacks
  - low nutrient conditions -- association with mycorrhizae facilitates water and nutrient uptake
  - shade intolerant
  - succession -- successionally stable or climax species on low-elevation, dry sites and seral (later phase) on more mesic and mid-elevation sites
