Leaves:
  - basal leaves
  - stiff
  - narrowly linear
  - 5--9 dm. long
  - 10--15 mm. broad
  - cauline leaves reduced upward
  - mostly basal, folded and clasp the stem at the base in a fan-like fashion
  - leaves sometimes die back over winter, but persist if winters are mild

Other characteristics:
  - monocot
  - herbaceous perennial from short, thick rhizomes
  - forms dense expanding clumps (3--4’ (~ to 5’) tall and to 30” wide)
  - simple, leafy flowering stem up to 1 m. tall

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to Europe to western Siberia, Caucasus, northern Africa
  - garden “escape” widely distributed throughout much of Washington
  - widely distributed throughout much of North America in temperate climates
  - found in ditches and ponds at low elevations; forms large colonies along streams, ponds and marshes
  - rows in water to 25 cm deep, or very near water, such as lakeside muds
  - pollinated by bumble-bees and long-tongued flies
  - seed dispersal -- seeds that mature and drop into water can float to other locations, aided by a corky constitution
  - vegetative reproduction:
    - via underground rhizomes, forms very dense monotypic stands, outcompeting other plants
    - able to re-sprout if top damaged or killed
  - tolerant of anoxia -- oxygen transported through spongy tissue (aerenchyma) to rhizomes below water
  - tolerant of drought -- underground rhizomes remain viable
  - herbivore defense:
    - tissues contain compounds that deter feeding (although muskrats will eat the rhizomes)
    - contact with the resins can cause skin irritation in animals
  - control:
    - dig up small isolated patches with pick-axes or hatchets, making sure to get the entire rhizome
    - repeated mowing or cutting may keep yellow flag iris contained and can potentially kill it by depleting the energy in the rhizomes after several years of intensive mowing
    - herbicides for use in aquatic systems may be the most effective and cost-effective option for eradication of large infestations
