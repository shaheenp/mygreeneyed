Leaves:
  - linear
  - flattened
  - spirally arranged
  - irregularly spaced
  - varied sizes but short (up to 3/4")
  - short leaves are half the length of long leaves
  - lower -- 2 white bands of stomata (ill-defined) and indistinct green margin
  - short petiole
  - blunt apex
  - attached to "pegs" on stems
  - most needles drop off branch portions closer to trunk

Cones:
  - pollen cones:
    - numerous
    - small
  - seed cones:
    - numerous
    - small (2 cm  long)
    - oblong
    - not stalked (sessile)
    - thin, smooth scales
  - cones are produced in growing season, fertilization occurs and seeds develop and are shed in the second growing season
  - seeds have large sings that facilitate dispersal by wind

Other characteristics:
  - tree up to 200 ft.
  - evergreen
  - drooping leader
  - horizontal or gracefully down-sweeping branches and delicate foliage

Relevant info:
  - similar to *T. canadensis*, an east coast (North America) species
  - cinnamon-red furrowed bark contains tannins used in tanning animal hides and in dyeing mountain goat wool and basket materials red in PNW Native American cultures
  - Washington's state tree

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - Alaska to California, east to Montana, but much more common west of the Cascades
  - found in moist, deep forests from sea level to mid-elevations in the mountains
  - one of the most shade tolerant trees on the Pacific coast:
    - shade leaves are thinner than leaves exposed to full sun, which maximizes light-capturing area while minimizing investment in leaf tissue
    - relatively low light-saturated photosynthesis per unit leaf area in shady conditions
    - leaves deep in canopy can survive with 1% of full sunlight
    - shade tolerance enables species to self-replace in stands
    - on low branches, needles are concentrated near ends of branches
  - tolerates low nutrient sites (though higher N results in more biomass production)
    - seeds can germinate on soils ranging from rotting wood to bare mineral soil as long as enough moisture is present
  - tolerates low oxygen -- adapted to wetter soils by developing shallow root system (that has easier access to oxygen in air), though shallow roots make trees susceptible to wind throw
  - pollination by wind
  - sexual reproduction:
    - cones are produced every year and especially abundant every 3 or 4 years
    - seeds remain viable for one growing season only
  - seed dispersal -- seeds have large wings that enable them to be distributed over long distances by wind
  - herbivory:
    - Roosevelt elk and black-tailed deer browse branches
    - deer mice consume significant portions of seed fall
    - black bears, snowshoe hares and rabbits, and mountain beavers eat other parts of saplings and young trees
  - herbivory protection -- tannins in bark are defense against herbivory and insect infestation
  - low fire resistance due to thin bark, shallow roots, highly flammable foliage, and a low-branching habit, with lichen covering branches
    - however frequency of fire is low due to their commonly occupied cool mesic habitats
  - succession -- shade tolerance makes this species a late-successional component but one that, in the absence of disturbance, can become the dominant, self-replacing canopy (since seedlings and saplings are shade tolerant)
