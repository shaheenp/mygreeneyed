Relevant info:
  - flowers usually fragrant, attracting bees, wasps, flies and moths
  - good honey plant
  - wood used commercially for furniture, toys, boxes, musical instruments, clogs, beehives, etc.
  - desirable because it is light, soft and resistant to splitting
  - commercially harvested in Great Lakes region
  - can live >1,000 yrs
  - in Britain, known as “lime tree” from 1620s, earlier “line” (c. 1500), from Middle English “lynde” (early 14c.), from Old English “lind"
  - in Central Europe, intensification of agriculture 5,000--7,000 years ago diminished abundance of native linden
  - “Basswood” derived from “bastwood” [sic], in reference to the tough inner bark (“bast”) which has been used to make rope and mats

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - over 2 dozen species, many of which can hybridize, primarily in temperate and subtropical regions
  - pollination -- volatile oils in flowers attract bees, wasps, flies and moths
  - herbivore & microbial defense -- compounds (e.g., tannins, flavonoids) produced as herbivory and pathogen defenses, but long-term survival depends on regenerative abilities
  - adapted to wind -- well-developed root systems that enable it to tolerate wind
  - seed dispersal -- nutlets are attached to elongated wings, which aid dispersal by wind
  - in Arboretum collection:
    - *T. mongolica* (Mongolian linden) native to eastern China, including Inner Mongolia, and far eastern Russia
    - *T. platyphyllos* (Simmer linden)
      - *platyphyllos* = from Greek *playts* meaning 'broad' + *phyllon* meaning 'leaf' in reference to the large leaves
      - native to central and southern Europe (including Great Britain, where it is possibly only native in woods on calcareous soils) and, less commonly, southwestern Asia
      - found especially in lowland woodlands with shallow humus-calcareous soils in warmer climates, which are required for pollination to be completed
      - long-lived, able to survive more than 1,000 years
      - distinguished by hairy young stems and leaves
      - vegetative reproduction:
        - re-sprouts from root collar following damage or cutting
        - root suckers are produced as much as 5 m from parent tree
        - branches touching the ground may become rooted and produce vertical shoots
      - shade tolerant -- invests in vertical growth over girth or forked stems, though some trees increase horizontal branching to increase light capture
      - drought tolerance:
        - stomatal closure decreases water loss through transpiration
        - naturally high starch concentrations may permit rapid degradation that leads to higher soluble sugar concentrations, which keeps water from flowing out of plant tissue
        - increases leaf and total xylem biomass and invests in invests in water transport efficiency by producing wider vessels at the stem apex to decrease the risks of cavitation (air bubbles)
      - wildlife -- seeds are eaten by small mammals, but behavior of moles (digging and collecting seeds) can aid seed dispersal
    - *T. americana* (American basswood, American linden)
      - *americana* = reference to native territory of species in Eastern U.S.
      - native to Eastern U.S. and is one of 6 species that characterizes the Eastern Deciduous Forest ecoregion
      - found in both dry upland and moist, low woods
      - pollinated by bees
      - shade tolerance:
        - shade leaves are thinner than sun leaves, which minimizes investment in light-capture surface
        - stomatal density and size are lower on shade leaves, perhaps indicating less need to prevent water loss in cooler, less exposed conditions
