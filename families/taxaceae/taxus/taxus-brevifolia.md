Cones:
  - male and female cones are inconspicuous
  - dioecious
  - instead of seed cone, produces a singly bony seed with bright red aril

Other characteristics:
  - thunk is limby and often contorted, the branches spreading or drooping
  - bark very thin, consisting of purplish scales covering the reddish or reddish-purple inner bark

Relevant info:
  - aril is poisonous to humans
  - bark contains taxol, a compound used to treat cancer
  - heavy, dense wood was used by Native Americans/First Nations to carve implements such as bows, mat-sewing needles, dip-net frames, and canoe spreaders

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - in the southern PNW coast, open to deep, usually moist mature forest from sea level to middle elevations in the mountains, often with Doug-fir and w. hemlock in old-growth forests as a small understory tree
  - from Vancouver Island north, in low-elevation, open, scrubby redcedar-w. hemlock forests, as a mid-canopy or understory tree or shrub
  - in Alaska and Northern mainland BC, only within a few kilometers of shoreline
  - abundance increases with increasing precipitation.
  - seed dispersal:
    - fleshy aril attracts songbirds, such as thrushes which disperse seed
    - also eaten by ringtails (relative of raccoon)
  - wildlife - leaves and sometimes bark browsed by deer, elk and moose, especially in winter
  - allopathy - limits competition from other plants by producing compounds in leaves that leach from the litter and inhibit seedling growth of other species
  - most shade tolerant tree in the PNW
  - temperature sensitive and may require shade in less humid climates
  - vegetative reproduction -- establishes beneath closed canopy by seed or layering
    - layering enables Pacific yew to quickly expand into gaps created as nearby senescent conifers fall
    - sprouts generally develop from broken stumps
  - herbivory defense -- multiple compounds (terpenes, phenyl-butanoids, taxane) in needles deter herbivory and prevent microbial infection
  - sensitive to fire, even low-intensity fire, due to thin bark
