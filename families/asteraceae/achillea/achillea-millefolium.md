Other characteristics:
  - one to several stems .5-3.5' in height
  - rhizomatous

Relevant info:
  - perennial aromatic herb
  - medicinal plant used by indigenous people for sore throats, bronchitis, cold/coughs, measles, blood purification, headaches, stomach ache, diarrhea, and a coagulant to stop bleeding
  - many cultivars, including 'Paprika', 'Cerise Queen' & 'Red Beauty'
  - useful in gardens by attracting predatory insects such as wasps, which drink the nectar and then use insect pests as food for their larvae
  - naturalized in North America after being introduced during European colonial period; may become weedy or invasive in some regions or habitats and displace desirable vegetation if not properly managed

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - common and widespread
  - found in dry to moist, well-drained, open sites, meadows, rocky slopes, gravel bars, roadsides, and open forest
  - from sea level to 11,500' in elevation
  - prefers well-drained soil in full sun, but can tolerate other conditions
  - drought tolerant -- through avoidance (seasonal cycle is completed before onset of drought)
  - pollination -- by insects
    - food source for many species of insects such as bees and butterflies (larval host for Painted Lady butterfly)
    - also attracts birds
  - vegetative reproduction -- re-sprouts from fragmented rhizomes on disturbed sites
  - fire tolerant -- survives low intensity fire by re-sprouting from rhizomes
  - seed dispersal -- fluff attached to seed aids dispersal by wind
