Leaves:
  - simple
  - basal
  - oblong-ovate
  - fleshy
  - entire margins
  - short-stalked leaves are largest of any native plant in PNW (30--150 cm. long (12--60")

Flowers:
  - on thick spadex (spike-like inflorescence)
  - surrounded by large, yellow spathe (leaf-like bract) up to 2 dm long
  - yellowish-green tiny flowers on spadex
  - protogynous, i.e., spadix emerges from the spathe as a pistillate inflorescence and transitions to a pollen-producing male phase several days later
  - female flowers are lower on the spadix and male flowers are above.

Fruit:
  - berry-like
  - greenish
  - 1--2 seeded
  - embedded in white pulpy axis of spadix (~2" long in aggregate)



Other characteristics:
  - one of the first plants to bloom in late winter/early spring
  - monocot
  - slow growing, but may be up to 80 years-old



Relevant info:
  - the only other species in this genus occurs in Japan and the Russian Far East
  - leaves used by Native Americans in PNW for lining berry baskets, berry-drying racks and steaming pits
  - because of attractive yellow spathe, species was introduced through the gardening trade to England in 1901
  - seen in the wild by 1947 and is now considered invasive in Europe, where the wetlands it occupies are themselves diminished
  - naturalized populations in the Netherlands have been targeted for eradication
  - listed as an "invasive alien species of concern" in the European Union in 2016

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to Alaska south to California
  - in Washington, both sides of the Cascades
  - found in wet often wooded areas (swamps, fens, muskeg, wet forest, mucky seepage areas, wet meadows) from sea level to mid-elevations in the mountains
  - pollination:
    - distinctive odor is emitted when blooming
    - combination of skunk, carrion (dead animal flesh) and garlic odors attracts pollinators, such as scavenging flies, midges and beetles that may feed on carrion
    - the beetle *Pelecomalius testaceum* is the principal pollinator and feeds on the pollen and uses the spadex as a mating site
      - recent research indicates that this beetle specifically responds electrophysiologically and behaviorally to indole (compound with 2 carbon rings) in the flowers, without any additional association with carrion or feces, indicating a close association with the plant species
  - seed dispersal:
    - via water downstream
    - eaten by squirrels and bears and possibly birds, which may disperse seeds upstream
  - vegetative reproduction -- spreads via rhizomes up to 30 cm long
  - herbivore defense:
    - leaves contain calcium oxalate rhaphides (needle-shaped crystals with sharp tips) that are loaded in specialized, explosive ejector cells on the edge of leaves and surface of stems
    - under pressure, such as crushing of the plant when chewed by an animal, the needle-like crystals are ejected and penetrate surrounding tissue, resulting in intense irritation, discomfort, histamine release, numbness, paralysis of tongue, and trouble swallowing
  - shade tolerance:
    - early emergence and extremely large leaf surface captures maximum light
    - tall, erect leaves enable plant to reach above surrounding ground cover species
  - adapted to wetlands:
    - seed dispersal by water
    - vegetative reproduction decreases reliance on germinating seeds that need oxygen
  - competition -- large leaves emerge early in growing season and capture more light than competing neighbors in the ground cover
