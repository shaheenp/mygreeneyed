Other characteristics:
  - erect to straggly shrub to 10 ft.
  - young stems green and quadrangular (cross-section is square)

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - both sides of the Cascades in Washington; Alaska south to California, east to Montana and New Mexico
  - moist forest, clearings, open woods, stream-side habitats, swamps and thickets
  - at low to subalpine elevations
  - brackish tidal swamps and sandy areas along the coast
  - shade tolerant but often found in full sun
    - shade leaves have been observed to be larger and thinner than sun leaves, maximizing light capture area and minimizing investment in each photosynthesizing structure
  - pollinated by insects (bee flies, bees and butterflies) and hummingbirds seeking nectar and pollen
  - seed dispersal -- fruits consumed, acid-washed and deposited by birds, such as quail, grouse, thrushes and other songbirds, and small mammals
  - wildlife:
    - food for birds and small mammals
    - host for the larva of certain butterflies, including Gillettâ€™s checkermallow, which hatch from eggs deposited in leaves exposed to the greatest amount of sunlight
  - herbivory and microbial defense:
    - leaves and stems contain bitter-tasting compounds that deter herbivores and defend against microbial attack
    - these tissues are generally not considered palatable to large mammals, but elk, moose, mountain goats, and deer browse the leaves or twigs in some areas
    - hairs on leaves and flowers discourage herbivores and insects
  - adapted to wide range of soils that vary from coarse sand to fine textured silt and clay with a pH of 5 to 8 (moderately high acidity to slightly basic), and from moist to saturated
  - can tolerate low salinity (<5 ppt), for example, growing among or on driftwood just above the high tide line
    - hairs on leaves may aid water regulation and prevent loss
