Fruit:
  - follicles (reminiscent of a pine cone)

Other characteristics:
  - shrub or small tree
  - deciduous
  - flowers appear before leaves
  - flowers in late winter/early spring

Relevant info:
  - among the oldest (earliest evolved) of Angiosperms
  - cultivated in its native Japan for centuries
  - at least two dozen cultivars exist

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to the Tokai region of Central Japan in wetlands from 40-700 m. in elevation
  - pollination:
    - by beetles, which indicates early evolution (before bees evolved)
    - species is protogynous, i.e., flowers first  open with the female parts of the flower receptive, then close, and reopen with the male parts (stamens) ready to shed pollen
    - this sequence decreases likelihood of self-pollination, thus widening the gene pool
    - species is endangered, perhaps due to population fragmentation and because seed production is strongly limited by both pollen shortage and self-pollination, which may have results in in-breeding depression
    - some studies suggest that large numbers of flowers increase the attractiveness for pollinators, and this outweighs the negative effects of self-pollination
    - flower/fruit production is affected by light intensity so the regeneration of this species appears to be limited to well-lit sites
    - cessation of traditionally managed landscapes has led to secondary succession in many places, negatively affecting populations of this species
    - thinning of upper canopy has been proposed as a conservation strategy
  - vegetative reproduction -- via layering (branches that touch the ground produce roots and establish a new unit)
