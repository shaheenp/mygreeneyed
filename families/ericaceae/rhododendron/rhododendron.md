Relevant info:
  - 850 species (not all hardy), thousands of cultivars
  - genus includes azaleas
  - *R. macrophyllum* is the state flower of WA

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - *R. macrophyllum*
    - moist woods, sea level to moderate elevations in the mountains
    - west of the Cascades crest in WA, BC, south to CA
  - fire resilient -- re-sprouts well after fire from stem bases or shallow, tuber-like root crown
  - tolerates low-nitrogen soil w/ help of mycorrhizal association
  - shallow roots maintain access to O<sub>2</sub> for respiration, even in moist forests
  - seed dispersal -- winged-seeds aid dispersal by wind
