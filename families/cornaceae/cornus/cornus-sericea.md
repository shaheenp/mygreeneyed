Other characteristics:
  - deciduous shrub to 9 ft.
  - dark red branchlets
  - prostrate and often rooting lower branches
  - many new cultivars w/ yellow, orange, and bright red branches (coppice to keep desired color)
  - red stems somewhat resemble the reddish stems of some osier willows

Relevant info:
  - regarded as an aggressive/invasive species in south-central Canada and Mid-western US
  - Northwest form was formerly known as *C. stolonifera* var. *occidentalis*
    - accepted name is now *C. sericea* subsp. *occidentalis* or *C. occidentalis* (creek dogwood, western red osier), depending on source

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to Alaska to California, common both sides of the Cascades, east to Idaho
  - found in moist soil, typically in swamps, wet meadows, marshes, lake shores, river banks, and streamside forest and scrub (shrub-dominated), but also in open upland forest and thickets and (in Alaska) rocky shorelines, bog-forest edges and disturbed sites
  - valley bottoms to middle elevations (0--2000 m.)
  - vegetative reproduction:
    - shrubs often form clumps or dense thickets by stolons and prostrate, rooting stems and lower branches
    - stolons can extend as far as 10 ft. (3 m.) from parent plant
    - regenerates from root crowns following stem damage or top-kill
    - cuttings of young branches (live stakes) used in wetland restoration
  - pollinated by bees (especially bumble bees), flies, and butterflies
  - seeds are dispersed by many birds and mammals (including bears, woodrats, chipmunks and mice) that eat the fruit, which are a desirable food source because they're high in fat and moderately high in protein
  - tolerant of scouring and flooding and large fluctuations in water level:
    - lenticels (pores) in bark facilitate absorption of oxygen that is transported to roots in saturated or flooded soils
    - vegetative reproduction reduces reliance on seeds for spreading (germinating seeds can "drown" in wet conditions due to lack of oxygen)
  - shade tolerance:
    - shrubs growing in full sun are typically dense and compact, with many lateral branches
    - shrubs growing in shade are typically open and sprawling, with few branches, with maximizes light capture
    - leaves growing in the shade are generally larger and thinner than those growing in full sun, which maximizes light capture and minimizes investment in photosynthesizing structures
  - wildlife:
    - twigs are important winter browse for moose, elk, deer, but stands may be reduced with repeated browsing
    - mountain goats, beavers, and rabbits also browse
