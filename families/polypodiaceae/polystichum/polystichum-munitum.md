*munitum* -- *munitus* (Latin), meaning 'fortified' or 'armed' (with teeth along serrated edges), in reference to pinna

Native range: Western US and Canada

Leaves:
  - "fronds"
  - grow from a woody rhizome
  - up to 1.5 m. tall
  - erect to arching
  - pinnately compound
  - leaflets ("pinna"):
    - dagger-shaped
    - serrate
    - alternate
  - sori exist year-round on fronds

Reproduction:
  - alternation of generations
  - sori are round and in two rows, one on either side of pinna mid-vein

Other characteristics:
  - evergreen, perennial, long-lived
  - new fronds emerge from rhizomes early each growing season

Relevant info:
  - in managed landscapes, often cut back in the spring to showcase the new growth
  - used in floral industry
    - enormous quantities of leaves are harvested for backgrounds in funeral wreaths and other floral displays
    - exported to Europe

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native from British Columbia south to California, east to Montana
  - forested areas throughout Washington
  - found in moist coniferous woods, in open to deep shade
  - from sea-level to midmontane
  - abundant and widespread from central Vancouver Island and adjacent mainland south, less common further north
  - spores dispersed by wind and water
  - vegetative reproduction:
    - limited
    - can regenerate from rhizomes after top-kill but does not spread vegetatively
    - rhizomes are short
    - plants grow in separate, individual clumps but often form extensive populations
  - very shade tolerant:
    - but can also grow in open areas
    - optimal growth can be achieved in light conditions that are as low as 3% of full sunlight due to low light saturation point at which photosynthesis proceeds efficiently
  - adapted to dry conditions -- cuticular waxes seal plant surfaces against excessive water loss and are complex mixtures of very-long-chain aliphatics (carbon compounds without rings)
  - adapted to low nutrient conditions:
    - evergreen fronds preserve investment in photosynthesizing structures
    - mycorrhizae aid nutrient and water uptake are likely, based on research on other members of this genus
  - fire-tolerant:
    - top-killed by fire
    - rhizomes likely survive low and moderate fires, where soil heating is not severe and soil remains intact
  - wildlife:
    - herbivores include mammals, such as elk, black-tailed deer, mountain beavers, American black bears, and mountain goats
    - *P. munitum* communities also provide habitat for several bird species
