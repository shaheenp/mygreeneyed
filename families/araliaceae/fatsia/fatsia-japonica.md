Other characteristics:
  - evergreen shrub to 15 ft.
  - many large stems

Relevant info:
  - Japanese name: Yatsude, which may refer to many-fingered-hand shape of leaf
  - introduced in Eastern China
  - formerly classified as *Aralia* by Swedish botanist Carl Thunberg (1748-1828), a pupil of Linneas
  - in same family as English ivy

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native coastal woodlands from South Korea to Japan to Nansei-shoto (islands between Japan and Taiwan)
  - very shade tolerant:
    - evergreen leaves photosynthesize all year
    - able to acclimate to different light conditions by altering its anatomical and physiological characteristics (e.g., photosynthetic rate, light compensation point & light saturation point (which increase in high light) & chlorophyll content (which increases in low light)
    - in full sun, plant experiences mid-day depression in photosynthesis as stomata close to avoid water loss
    - leaf size and thickness decrease under low light, so acclimation to low light limits biomass production
  - cold tolerant and frost resistant (to -5ÂºC) -- due to increase in protective, antioxidant enzymes that prevent cellular damage
  - vegetative reproduction -- produces suckers from trunk base
  - pollination:
    - by insects, especially wasps and flies
    - fall timing decreases competition for pollinators
  - seed dispersal -- by birds consuming fruit
  - herbivore protection -- toxic compounds in flower buds, flowers, mature fruits, and leaves
