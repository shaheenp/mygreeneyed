Relevant info:
  - heavily used in hedges & topiaries
  - new leaves in "cabbage head" may indicate insect or disease problem
  - has become locally naturalized in parts of North America

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native primarily to open woodlands and rocky hillsides in southern Europe, northern Africa and western Asia
    - usually in understory of forests of larger trees, most commonly associated with European beech (*Fagus sylvatica*) forests, but also sometimes in open dry montane scrub, particularly in the Mediterranean region
    - typically grows on soils derived from chalk, limestone
  - chemical compounds (alkaloids) in leaves protect against microbial infection and herbivory
  - drought tolerant -- leathery leaves help retain water
  - evergreen leaves help preserve nutrients in low- nutrient soils
  - leaves accumulate red carotenoids to maintain protection from solar radiation, while green chlorophyll decreases during winter acclimation
