Relevant info:
  - related to *[Cornus]({{ "/cornaceae/cornus/"  | relative_url }})* (dogwood) and *Nyssa* (tupelo)
  - millions of years ago, this ancient species was more widely distributed (including Japan and North America)
  - sometimes referred to as a living fossil
  - now limited in distribution and endangered in its native region due to human activity (development)
  - introduced to Britain in 1901 after a 22-yr-old Kew-trained botanist was sent to China with a hand-drawn map and a few written instructions (and no ability to speak Chinese)
    - he suffered illness, near drowning, and other mishaps but found the tree and sent seeds back to the nurseryman who had sponsored his trip

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to woodlands of Central and Southern China
  - often found in evergreen broad-leaved forests or in mixed forests of deciduous broad-leaved trees at elevations of between 1100 and 2600 m
  - also found in forests, on hillsides or beside streams a lower elevations (250-1500 m)
  - shade tolerance:
    - leaves are relatively thin, which maximizes light capture area and minimizes investment in photosynthesizing structure
    - thinner and more loosely arranged structural layers and lower stomatal density in leaves (than leaves of sun plants) are consistent with a lower photosynthetic rate
  - pollination:
    - by several genera of bees
    - bracts attract pollinators and protect the pollen from rain damage
  - herbivory defense -- tannins in plant tissue interfere with herbivore's proteins (enzymes) involved in cell division and DNA transcription and repair
