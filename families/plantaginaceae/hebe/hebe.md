*Hebe* -- "young maturity" or "bloom of youth" (Greek); honoring the Greek goddess of youth and cup-bearer to the gods, serving them nectar and ambrosia
  - she was the youngest of the Olympian gods and believed to have the power to restore youth

Native range: New Zealand, SE Australia, Chile, and Rapa (French Polynesia)

Leaves:
  - strongly opposite, decussate (pairs of leaves are perpendicular to the pair above and below)
  - ~entire
  - sometimes scale-like
  - conspicuous scars once leaves fall

Flowers:
  - inflorescence -- upright dense spike-like heads in leaf axils, may be greatly reduced
  - 4-lobed (~3-5 parted)
  - 2 stamens, exserted
  - 1 style
  - white, purple
  - herkogamy (spatial separation of pollen and stigmas within flower)

Fruit:
  - capsules (non-fleshy)
  - 2 cells
  - many small seeds

Other notes:
  - evergreen
  - vary in life-form from large leafy shrubs to matted plants with whipcord-like branches, on which the leaves are almost reduced to scales
  - branches w/ conspicuous leaf scars
  - *Hebe* cultivars are used in gardens in California and along the coast of WA and OR
    - smaller leaved cultivars are hardier
    - others are sensitive to cold, best in sun and protected conditions
    - cultivar near Graham Visitors Center (WA Park Arboretum) appears to be - or resembles - *Hebe pinguifolia* 'Pagei'
  - classification is unresolved
    - genus moved to *Veronica* (hence common name shrubby Veronica) and back to *Hebe*
    - family was formerly Scrophulariaceae, which some sources still use
  - largest genus of New Zealand shrubs, with 80+ species
    - New Zealand is where the most adaptive radiation (evolution of species) of this genus has occurred due to its isolation, heterogenous landscape, and latitudinal range
    - population of original species were fragmented by changing sea levels, mountain-building, volcanism, and glaciation
    - then the combined influences of inbreeding, genetic drift, and strong selection acted upon small populations
    - distributions of species are generally limited in area


Ecology & Adaptations:
  - Native to New Zealand, SE Australia, Chile and sites in the South Pacific
  - found in a variety of habitats but are most common in alpine shrubland, grassland, and fellfield (treeless, rock-strewn areas)
  - several occur in coastal, lowland, and montane shrubland
  - the following adaptations are representative of various species within the genus:
    - sexual reproduction & pollinators:
      - some spp. have long flowering period (Nov--Mar) because flowers are produced sequentially in pairs at the growing end of branches
      - characterized by herkogamy (spatial separation of pollen and stigmas within a flower) to minimize self- pollination
      - some groups display gender dimorphism, which is positively correlated with altitude: pollinator fauna also changes with altitude, going from mainly solitary bees at lower altitudes to dipteran flies and beetles at higher altitudes (>1,000 m)
      - separate sexes (flower dimorphism) may have been selected to enforce outcrossing in higher altitudes where pollinators are less efficient at cross-pollination/ selected as a consequence of high rates of selfing at higher altitudes.
      - Short-tongued bees move quickly, fly between plants frequently, and prefer to visit flowers with pollen that is used to feed young
      - in contrast, beetles rarely move between plants and tachinid flies visit flowers in all stages in their search for nectar
      - therefore likely that bees outcross flowers to a greater extent than other pollinators
      - High-altitude species adapted by separating the sexes to enforce outcrossing
    - seed dispersal -- dried capsules dehisce seeds
    - seed germination:
      - requires light
      - seed is small and readily buried, but remains viable for at least a year, so can form a persistent soil seed bank
      - most mountain species require colder temperatures as low as 6oC to germinate while seed of species from lowland and lower mountain habitats germinate at higher temperatures of 20-25°C
    - herbivore defense:
      - phenolic glycosides interfere with digestion in herbivores
      - divaricate (branching) growth form may be an adaptation to deter browsing by extinct avian herbivores (moa, flightless bird that went extinct ~600 yrs ago when humans arrived on the NZ islands)
      - wide angle branching makes plants difficult for birds to swallow
    - drought tolerance:
      - lowered water potential in tissues (via concentration of compounds) prevents water loss
      - dense mats of fibrous roots efficiently absorb available water
    - wind tolerance -- in exposed areas, stems are prostrate (low- growing, with branches lying on ground and only new growth growing erect)
    - frost tolerance -- wide-angle branching of divaricate plants may provide a 'frost-screen,' protecting interior leaves from frost damage
    - tolerates low-nutrient conditions:
      - evergreen leaves prolong value of investment in photosynthesizing structures
      - mycorrhizae aid nutrient uptake
