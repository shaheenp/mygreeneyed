Fruit:
  - capsules with 4 valves
  - sepals persistent

Other characteristics:
  - primarily low shrubs, some trees to 20 ft.
  - densely branched
  - often flowers in early to mid spring

Other notes:
  - center of diversity is in South Africa, where ~700 species are endemic Heathers (vs. heaths) are in the genus *Calluna*, also in [Ericaceae](../)

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - *E. carnea*:
    - native to the mountains of Central and SE Europe, often in pine forests
    - called snow heath or spring heath because it may bloom in snow or in spring
  - adapted to cool summers -- evergreen leaves limit need for production of new photosynthetic structures and enable plant to make use of available light and temperature-dependent photosynthetic rates
  - adapted to snow and wind -- low-growing shrub habit and small, narrow leaves are suited to weathering exposed slopes and snowfall
  - adapted to low nutrient, rocky conditions:
    - slow growth rate keeps demand low
    - evergreen leaves conserve nutrients investment in photosynthesizing structures
  - pollination by wind, birds, or insects, depending on species
