Other characteristics:
  - ultimately 50--75'(to 40 m.) tall to 10' (3 m.) diameter, 10--20' (3--6 m.) spread
  - bark reddish brown, shedding in strips
  - pyramidal shape
  - spreading branches with flattened horizontal branchlets that droop at the ends
  - branchlets are rounded at the end (obtuse) instead of coming to a point as in *[Thuja](../../thuja/)* or *[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana](../chamaecyparis-lawsoniana/)*.

Relevant info:
  - usually smaller cultivar forms are used in managed landscapes in PNW
  - in Japan, *hinoki* = fire tree
    - used to make fire by friction, a practice still employed at Shinto shrines
  - one of the 'Five sacred Trees of Kiso' in Japan
  - historically, very important species used in Japanese architecture
  - considered "near threatened" by IUCN due to habitat fragmentation and overexploitation

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to Southern Japan & Taiwan
  - found in temperate mixed *[Chamaecyparis](../)* and broad-leaved mountain forests below 2,800 m., also exposed sites at high elevation
  - pollination by wind
  - seed dispersal -- small "wings" facilitate dispersal by wind
  - sexual reproduction & competition:
    - wood of downed mature *C. obtusa* trees are key sites of *C. obtusa* seedling regeneration
    - wood contains salicylic acid, one of several compounds that appear to have an inhibiting (allelopathic) effect on the growth of other tree, shrub and herbaceous species
  - vegetative reproduction -- may be limited to layering that occurs when trees are felled by wind
  - herbivory defense -- compounds (terpenes) produced in the tissues inhibit some mammal herbivory (e.g., cervids such as deer) and insect infestation
