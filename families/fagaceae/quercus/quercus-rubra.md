Relevant info:
  - tallest and most rapidly growing of the oaks
  - one of the most important ornamental and timber trees in *[Quercus](../)*
  - *Quercus rubra---stick it to ya!* (in reference to pointed lobes with bristle tips)
  - first bears fruit at 25 years
  - acorns eaten by Native Americans, leached with ashes to remove bitter tannins
  - state tree of New Jersey

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native from Nova Scotia to Pennsylvania, west to Minnesota and Iowa
  - found in dry-mesic to mesic (moderately moist) sites
  - in rich, mesic woods, on sandy plains, rock outcrops, stable inter-dunes, and at the outer edges of floodplains
  - most common on north- and east-facing slopes
  - lower and middle slopes, in coves, ravines, and on valley floors
  - pollinated by wind
  - seed dispersal:
    - primarily by birds and mammals
    - scatter-hoarders such as the gray squirrel are particularly important dispersal agents in some areas because they bury seeds and fail to recover many over the winter
    - mice and chipmunks move seeds up to 98 feet
    - blue jays transport seed from several hundred yards up to 3 miles
  - vegetative regeneration:
    - commonly sprouts vigorously after plants are damaged or killed by fire or mechanical injury
    - sprouts grow from roots and epicormic buds beneath the bark of older oaks
  - fire adaptation:
    - older, larger individuals often survive fire
    - young, small trees typically re-sprout vigorously from the stump or root collar
    - stem density often increased as fire promotes sprouting and reduces competition
    - more susceptible to fire than many other species of oak because tight, solid bark is typically more seriously damaged than rough, corky bark of species such as white oak
    - capable of minimizing fire-caused losses due to damaged cambium by re-routing the functions of fire-killed portions within weeks after a fire
    - reduced fire frequency (government policy of fire suppression) has favored more shade-tolerant hardwoods and contributed to the decline of oak dominance in Eastern forests
    - to regenerate E. oak forests, frequent prescribed burning is needed to compensate for decades of fire exclusion
  - resistance to windthrow -- strongly developed taproot and a network of deep, spreading laterals
  - herbivory defense -- tannins in leaves and acorns inhibit digestion in herbivores by interfering with the actions of enzymes involved with breaking down proteins
  - wildlife:
    - white-tailed deer, elk, hares, and moose browse leaves and young seedlings
    - mice, chipmunks and squirrels eat acorns
    - acorns are important food source for bobwhite, red-headed woodpecker, blue jay, wild turkey (which can eat >200 acorns in one "meal") and many other birds and waterfowl
    - sprouted acorns are eaten by deer, mice, and the northern bobwhite
    - tree branches provide cover, perching and nesting sites and nesting materials for birds and small animals, and denning sites for mammals
