Leaves:
  - alternate
  - simple
  - broadly elliptic (1.5--3” wide)
  - acute base
  - deep and doubly serrate
  - revolute at base of leaf
  - dull green above, rusty colored below
  - revolute (rolled under) margin

Flowers:
  - monoecious
  - male -- long pendulous catkins develop before the leaves on growth of the previous season
  - female -- short upright catkins

Fruit:

  - persist on tree over the winter
  - each cone contains up to 100 small nutlets that are wind dispersed

Other characteristics:

Relevant info:
  - lives up to 100 yrs, reaching 80--100 ft.
  - largest American alder
  - generally short-lived, early successional species
  - Native Americans:
    - used inner bark to dye fish nets, making it harder for fish to avoid them
    - used for medicinal purposes: contains salicin, which is closely related to acetylsalicylic acid (AKA aspirin)
    - wood used for utensils
    - coals used to smoke salmon
  - important commercial tree
    - wood used to make inexpensive furniture, small wooden items, and paper pulp

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native chiefly west of the Cascades crest in Washington
  - Alaska south to California, disjunct to the east in northern Idaho
  - found at low elevations in moist woods, streambanks, floodplains, [land]slide tracks, recently cleared land (often in pure stands)
  - sexual reproduction:
    - drooping staminate (male) catkins are up to 12 cm long and clustered near the end of a twig
    - pistillate catkins are erect, 1.5-2 cm long, turning woody and conelike at maturity
  - pollination by wind
  - seed dispersal:
    - wind carries lightweight winged seeds
    - seed production is normally so prolific that dense stands quickly develop on exposed soils of clearcuts and burned areas
  - adapted to wetlands:
    - lenticels (pores) in bark facilitate transfer of oxygen to roots when soils are saturated
    - shallow root system facilitates access to oxygen
  - herbivore defense:
    - leaves contain tannins that reduce digestibility of tissue by binding with proteins
    - leaves, wood, and bark contain Oregonin, a glycoside, that reduces palatability and digestibility
  - adapted to low-nutrient conditions -- association with N-fixing bacteria in root nodules enables species to survive in disturbed and low-nutrient environments and enhance the protein content of the leaves
  - fire resistance:
    - thin bark is sufficiently fire resistant to protect trees from light surface fires
    - foliage and leaf litter do not carry fires well
    - stands often lack flammable understory debris and are often on moist sites, which burn infrequently
    - revegetates burned areas via seed from off-site plants
  - succession & disturbance:
    - early successional species
    - ability to establish is due in part to association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria
    - red alder communities were primarily restricted to streams and wet areas before European contact
    - since then, disturbances such as logging have provided an abundance of open sites with bare mineral soil, which favor red alder colonization.
  - wildlife:
    - as defense compounds decrease in concentration in autumn, leaves provide a significant source of protein to black-tailed deer and Roosevelt elk, especially as other sources of protein diminish
    - beavers eat the bark, and build dams and lodges with the stems
    - seeds eaten by birds (redpolls, siskins, goldfinches) and deer mice
