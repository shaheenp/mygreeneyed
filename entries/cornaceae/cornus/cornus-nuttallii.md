title: Cornus nuttallii
commonname: Pacific dogwood
family: Cornaceae
genus: Cornus
---

*cornu* -- horn (Latin) perhaps referring to the strength and density of the wood

*nuttallii* -- refers to Thomas Nuttall (1786-1859), American ornithologist and artist

Native range: US West cost & Idaho

Leaves:
  - opposite
  - simple
  - elliptic to obovate
  - 3-5" long, 1.5-3" wide
  - short acuminate apex
  - 5-6 vein pairs (arcuate)
  - 1/4-1/2" petiole
  - top of leaves dark green

Flowers:
  - dense head of purple-green flowers
  - 3/4" across
  - 4-5 (~6) bracts
    - oval to obovate, pointed
    - 1.5-3" long
    - 1-3" wide
    - white/cream

Fruit:
  - drupe
  - orange to red
  - 1/3" long
  - clusters

Other characteristics:
  - deciduous tree to 60 ft. w/ many branches
  - fall color -- red-pink
  - may have a second flush of flowers in late summer
  - bark is gray and smooth

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - moist but well-drained soils, on gentle slopes, predominantly occurring below 5,000 ft. (1,524 m.)
  - low frost tolerance, high flood tolerance & moderate shade tolerance -> common along stream banks in low-elevation (below 5,000 ft.) coniferous, hardwood, and mixed coastal forests in temperate climates
  - populations most abundant in subcanopy of Douglas-fir forests of the Puget Sound basin and redwood forests of CA
  - drought tolerant -- deep taproot
  - shade tolerant:
    - even at 1/3 full sunlight, maintains max. photosynthetic potential
    - branches are self-shading
      - leaf petioles orient downward allowing leaves to rest on and shade branches
    - trunk can be damaged by sunlight, but established plants may initiate shoot growth from crown to shade and protect the exposed trunk
    - seedlings germinate better in shaded conditions
  - fire tolerant -- re-sprouts from root crown and/or epicormic branching can occur
  - pollination by insects
  - sexual reproduction -- often flowers twice per season
  - seed dispersal -- fruit are eaten by birds, such as pileated woodpeckers, and small mammals, such as deer mice and red tree voles
  - vulnerable to anthracnose, a nonnative fungal disease caused by *Discula spp.*
