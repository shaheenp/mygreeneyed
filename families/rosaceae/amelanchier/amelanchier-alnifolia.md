Other characteristics:
  - deciduous trees or shrubs to 30 ft.
  - delicately branching

Relevant info:
  - fruits ferment on the shrub, which birds like
  - susceptible to rust
  - varieties overlap in distribution
    - typical variety (*A. alnifolia* var. *alnifolia*) occurs from southern Alaska to southern Oregon, mostly east of the Cascades, and east to the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Colorado
    - *A. alnifolia* var. *humptulipensis* occurs on the western slope of the Cascades in BC and Washington
  - given the number of varieties of this species, local or on-site sources should be used for restoration or revegetation projects in the PNW

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - Alaska to California, east to the Dakotas and New Mexico
  - occurring throughout Washington
  - found in dry to moist open woods, canyons and hillsides, rocky shorelines, bluffs, talus slopes, meadows, thickets and forest edges
  - in well-drained soils
  - sea level to subalpine elevations.
  - pollination -- primarily self-pollinated but may be cross-pollinated via insects or wind
  - seed dispersal:
    - aided by the consumption of fruit by fur and game mammals (such as black bear, beaver, hares), upland game birds, and many species of rodents and songbirds
    - leathery seed coat prevents seeds from being digested in animal guts, though digestive acids will soften the coat
  - reproduces vegetatively:
    - from stolons and suckers (stems from roots), sprouting from the root crown, and by layering (branches root when they touch the ground)
    - underground portions of the plant include massive root crown, horizontal and vertical rhizomes, and an extensive root system
  - fire dependent:
    - re-sprouts from root crown and/or rhizomes after fire
    - abundance increases after fire
    - only somewhat shade tolerant, so populations decline as canopy closes in the absence of fire
  - response to herbivory and disturbance:
    - twigs and foliage browsed, especially in winter, by wild ungulates (e.g., deer, elk, mountain goats, bison), fur and game mammals (e.g. black bear, beaver, and hares)
    - responds to browsing and fire damage with increased twig production
    - spreads when canopy trees are killed by insect outbreaks
  - herbivore defense:
    - new leaves and young twigs contain toxic levels of hydrogen cyanide (prussic acid, cyanogenic glycosides), which is toxic and potentially fatal to ruminants such as deer
    - higher levels of this toxin are present in leaves and twigs during bloom stage and then rapidly decline
