Relevant info:
  - Stradivarius constructed violins from this dense wood, among others (smaller growth rings in cold climates creastes dense, resonant wood)
  - one of the most common and economically important species in Europe and Scandinavia
  - Most widely used horticultural spruce in North America
  - due to its commercial value, most intensively studied spruce in the world

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to N, C & E Europe outside permafrost areas, south to N Greece and W to the Massif Central, France
  - at southern edge of range, only in mountains above 400--500 m.
  - occurs in pure and mixed stands (both mixed conifer and mixed conifer-deciduous)
  - mature Norway spruce forests typically have very little ground layer vegetation
  - in Europe, red deer strip the bark of Norway spruce
    - increasing deer populations in Scandinavia are affecting commercial stands of this tree species
  - pollination by wind
  - herbivore and microbial defense:
    - terpenoids are chemical compounds that give N. spruce its distinctive aroma and that also function as defense against herbivory and microbial pathogens
    - concentrations are increased in response to disturbance or tissue damage
    - terpenoids interfere with growth of insect larva by mimicking hormones or disrupting cell division
    - aroma released after damage may attract enemies of the herbivore
    - despite these defenses, the species is vulnerable to western spruce budworm and mountain pine beetle in North America, where it has been introduced in Eastern U.S
  - shade tolerance:
    - shade needles are retained longer, maximizing return on investment
    - sun needles are thicker than shade leaves
    - high nitrogen content of shade leaves indicates cost of light interception and is thought to improve light absorption per needle mass of shaded needles
    - it appears that adaptation of needle morphology to irradiance during the primary growth period largely determines the fate of needles during subsequent tree growth and development
  - seedlings & drought -- during dry summers, spruce litter buildup can create manganese concentrations that prevent regeneration of Norway spruce, a possible means of controlling establishment of seedlings during unfavorable conditions
  - frost tolerance -- in northern Scandinavia, frost hardening (secretion of substances that harden to form a protective cuticle) occurs in Sept and is lost quickly in early May
