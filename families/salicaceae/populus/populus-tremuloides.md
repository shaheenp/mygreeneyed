  - 4--6 mm long
  - on pedicles 1--2 mm long

Other characteristics:
  - smaller tree (to 25 m.)

Relevant info:
  - wood is used for particleboard and pulp
  - widest geographical distribution of any North American tree
  - found throughout cold and cool-temperate regions from coast to coast and from within the Arctic Circle to the north rim of the Valley of Mexico
  - from sea level in the north and east to north slopes of high elevations in the south
  - southerly locations, like Mt. Livermore, Texas, the most southerly stand in the flora area, may be Pleistocene (Ice Age) relicts
  - largest and oldest known aspen clone is the "Pando" clone on the Fishlake National Forest in southern Utah
    - over 100 acres in size and weighs more than 14 million pounds
    - aged at 80,000 years old, although 5--10,000 year-old clones are more common
  - soft whispering rustle of a quaking aspen is unlike the sound of any other tree in the forest

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - Alaska to California, east to Labrador and New Jersey
  - in Washington, broadly distributed, but chiefly east of the Cascades
  - found in dry to wet, open to closed woodlands and forests, edges of meadows and prairies, dry mountainsides, avalanche chutes, talus-slopes and canyon-heads, sites of human disturbance, timber cuts, mine tailings, gravel pits, quarries, roadsides, gentle slopes near valley bottoms, alluvial terraces, and along watercourses
  - sea level on both coasts to 11,500 ft. (3,505 m.) in northern Colorado
  - pollinated by wind
  - seed dispersal & germination:
    - seeds with tufts of hairs are dispersed by wind for distances of 1,600 ft. to several miles with heavy winds
    - also disperse by water, and can germinate while floating or submerged
    - few aspen seedlings survive in nature due to the short time a seed is viable, lack of moisture during seed dispersal, fungi, adverse day/night temperature changes, and unfavorable soil conditions
  - vegetative reproduction:
    - forms clonal stands connected by a common root system
    - groves often occupied by single clones and show no sexual reproduction but persist and spread by root suckers
    - when stems are killed (e.g., by fire) and apical dominance is removed, cytokinins (hormones) in the roots initiate root sprouting
    - clones share traits such as leaf shape and size, bark character, branching habit, resistance to disease and air pollution, sex, time of flushing, and autumn leaf color
  - fire adapted:
    - thin bark has little heat resistance, and all but larger diameter trees are easily top-killed by fire
    - root systems of top-killed stems send up a profusion of sprouts for several years after fire
    - they grow rapidly by extracting water, nutrients, and photosynthate from an extant root system, and may outcompete other woody vegetation
    - following a fire, a new, even-aged quaking aspen stand can develop within a decade
    - also establishes from off-site, wind-blown seed after fire
    - in contrast to most trees, quaking aspen is self-thinning and, without intervention, a mature forest of healthy trees can develop from dense sprouts
    - before fire-suppression practices began in 1900, low-intensity fire-return intervals were ~7--10 years in the intermountain west, including those used by Native Americans to manage the landscape
  - succession -- quintessential "foundation species" in early-successional forest ecosystems
  - herbivore & microbial defense:
    - phenolic glycosides (salicinoids) and condensed tannins
    - phenolic glycosides reduce feeding, growth and survival of insect herbivores and deter feeding by mammalian herbivores
    - tannins bind with plant proteins, making them more difficult to digest
  - low-nutrient conditions -- association with mycorrhizae facilitates water and nutrient uptake
  - wildlife:
    - provides important breeding, foraging, and resting habitat for a variety of birds and mammals
    - elk, moose, and mule and white-tailed deer consume the leaves, buds, twigs, bark, and sprouts
    - black and grizzly bears feed on forbs and berry-producing shrubs in quaking aspen understories, which also provide excellent denning and foraging sites for black bear
    - rabbits, hares and pikas eat plant, as do squirrels, pocket gophers, mice and porcupines
    - beaver consume the leaves, bark, and twigs, and use quaking aspen stems within 400 feet of waterways for constructing dams and lodges
    - provide important feeding and nesting sites for a diverse array of birds, such as sandhill crane, western wood pewee, six species of ducks, blue, ruffed, and sharp-tailed grouse, band-tailed pigeon, mourning dove, wild turkey, red-breasted nuthatch, and pine siskin
