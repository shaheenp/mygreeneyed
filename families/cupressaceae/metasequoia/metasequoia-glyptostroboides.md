Cones:
  - male and female structures borne on different branches
  - male cones in pairs on pendulous tassels (not found on young trees)
  - female cones purplish black oblong (9 x 5.5 mm) when young, nearly spherical (1.4--2.5 x 1.6--2.3 cm) when mature
  - pendulous, at end of branchlets or on long stalk ~5 cm
  - scales -- 12 pairs, opposite, decussate, peltate (shield-shaped)

Other characteristics:
  - deciduous tree
  - 70--100', up to 160' (50 m.) in China
  - trunk w/ "armpits" (depression below lateral branches) on older trees
  - fluted/buttressed trunk develops with maturity
  - open and delicate branching pattern (not twiggy and messy)
  - foliage emerges light green in spring, matures to deep green in summer and turns yellow then red-bronze in fall

Relevant info:
  - evolved near the Arctic Circle during a period when lowland winter temperatures seldom went below freezing, so polar light seasonality could have been a driving force for the evolution of deciduousness in this species
  - genus originally identified in the fossil record by a Japanese paleobotanist in 1941
  - living members of genus identified by Chinese botanists in 1943
  - seeds were sent to and grown by Missouri Botanic Garden and Univ. of California and Oregon in 1947
  - more fascinating details of this story found at: [OSU Landscape Plants -- Metasequoia glyptostroboides](https://landscapeplants.oregonstate.edu/plants/metasequoia-glyptostroboides)
  - "Dawn redwood" refers to the tree's early fossil record
  - State Fossil of Oregon, where it flourished 5 to 25 million years ago and can be found in the fossil record

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to SE and south-central China
  - found on moist sites, such as riparian habitats on valley floors and in moist ravine bottoms, wet lower slopes and montane river and stream valleys
  - on acidic, montane yellow-earth soils in regions with moderate climate
  - 750--1500 m.
  - pollination:
    - by wind
    - male cones are aggregated in clusters situated at the ends of long, flexible branches
    - male and female cone emerge in Fed/Mar, and pollen release occurs before the leaves emerge, which reduces the pollen deposition and wastage caused by leaves and twigs
    - cones ripen in early December and shed their seeds in late Dec/early Jan
  - seed dispersal -- small, light, and winged make seeds ideal for wind dispersal
  - seed germination:
    - best on open soils
    - may be limited by water availability
  - herbivory defense -- compounds (e.g., terpenes) produced in the tissues inhibit some mammal herbivory (e.g., cervids such as deer) and insect infestation
  - insect & disease resistance:
    - resists insects and disease due to accumulation of toxic secondary compounds in tissues
    - oil in cones contains compounds (mono- and sesquiterpenes, norlignans) that inhibit fungal infection
    - aromatic compounds in heartwood resist fungal decay (houses built with this wood in China we said to have lasted 7 generations of farmers)
  - tolerant of periodic flooding:
    - adapted to clay soil that is continually moist
    - buttresses/flutes may help stabilize trunk
    - wide, shallow root system may facilitate access to oxygen in air
  - cold tolerance:
    - tree buds survive cold temperatures down to -30ÂºC
    - possibly through extraorgan freezing, i.e., scales act as an ice sink, with water moving from bud cells to scales and becoming supercooled
  - mixed shade tolerance:
    - fast growing in full sun
    - capable of photosynthesizing at relatively low light levels (photosynthetic apparatus saturates at a relatively low level of light) yet does not tolerate suppression like most shade tolerant plants -- i.e., once experiences suppression, will not respond to higher light levels
    - intolerant of high light level -- chlorophyll content declines with increasing light intensity and the pigment rhodoxanthin increases, leading to a reddish cast in the upper leaves of the trees
