Relevant info:
  - tough stringy bark of bitter cherry was peeled off in horizontal or spiral strips or sheets and used for decorative overlay of coiled cedar-root baskets
  - presence is often evidence of past disturbance (e.g., fire, logging)
  - tree form is used in cultivation
  - two varieties are sometimes recognized:
    1. var. *emarginata*, shrub-like and more widespread form in the arid west
    2. var. *mollis*, small tree form found west of the Cascades

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native from British Columbia and Vancouver Island south to southern California and east to Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and New Mexico
  - found in moist forest and in gravelly or sandy soil along streams, and as a pioneer on logged and burned areas
  - rocky mountain slopes, subalpine, thickets on exposed sites, understory of conifer and oak forests
  - at low to middle elevations (0--3000 m.)
  - pollinated by insects
  - seed dispersed by birds eat fruit
  - vegetative regeneration -- resprouts from root crown and roots
  - fire adapted:
    - re-sprouting
    - germination of seeds in soils
    - dispersal of seeds from off site by birds
  - herbivore/microbial defense -- bark contains cyanide-producing compounds, which impart a bitter taste to the tissue and interfere with microbial and animal respiration if ingested
  - wildlife:
    - browsed by mule deer, elk, and black bear
    - preferred by Columbian black-tailed deer
    - fruits are eaten by birds, rodents, and small mammals and, in Washington, by slugs
    - in the Sierra Nevada, bitter cherry is utilized by mountain beaver
    - provides cover for Columbian sharp-tailed grouse
