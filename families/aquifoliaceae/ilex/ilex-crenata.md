Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to forests, thickets, and mountain slopes in Japan, Korea, China, and eastern Russia (Sakhalin)
  - shade tolerant understory species
  - drought tolerance due to waxy leaf coating (produced by glands) that helps prevent water loss
  - mycorrhiza associated with roots that aid nutrient uptake and enable nutrient deficiency tolerance
  - seed dispersal –- animals by eating fruit & excreting seeds
