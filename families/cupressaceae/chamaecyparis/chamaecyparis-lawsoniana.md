commonname: Lawson cypress, Port Orford cedar
family: Cupressaceae
genus: Chamaecyparis
---

*chamai* -- dwarf or on/to the ground (prostrate) [Greek]

*kyparissos* -- cypress tree (Greek)

*lawsoniana* -- named for Charles Lawson (1794-1873), a Scottish nurseryman who specialized in grass seeds and conifers
  - he grew trees from seed sent to him in 1854 by William Murray while working on his "Notes on California Trees"

Native range: Western N. America

Relevant info:
  - varies in growth form from shrub to tree w/ pyramidal growth to 200 ft.
  - in cultivation, reaches half height of the native
  - can live 600 years
  - leaf scent not as sweet as *[Thuja](../thuja/thuja.md)*, but sweeter than close relative Alaska yellow cedar (*Callitropsis nootkatensis*, formerly *Chamaecyparis nootkatensis*)
  - wood is commercially valuable, in part because of its ability to resist rot
    - species has suffered negative impact from timber industry
  - susceptible to non-native root rot fungus (*Phytophthora lateralis*) in U.S., which threatens survival of remaining stands
  - known in England & Europe as Lawson's Falsecypress, and has been popular in their gardens since first introduction
  - Port Orford, OR was location of first ID by western botanists
  - ~300 types or cultivars selected from this species, more than any other conifer

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - small native range
    - seaward slopes in a coastal belt along Pacific Coast mountain ranges from Coos Bay in southwestern Oregon to the Klamath River in northwestern California, with isolated populations in northern California at higher elevations (<1700 m.)
    - northern distribution is limited by frost
  - cool Mediterranean climate (warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters) with summer fog, from which it is able to capture moisture on branchlets
  - inland, found on moist sites (seeps, stream channels, bogs) or locations with lots of precipitation
  - sandy and clay loams and rocky ridges
  - adapted to ultramafic soils with high metal content
    - compounds in sapwood (phloem) bind with metal ions, which prevents them from catalyzing damaging oxidation reactions within the tissues.
  - very shade tolerant
    - slow growth rates
    - shaded individuals often take on a shrubby form, without a strong vertical leader (trunk)
  - pollination by wind
  - seed dispersal:
    - usually within 1-3 tree heights
    - small wings help the seed be carried by wind and float on water, which may be important in stream-side habitats
    - produces abundant seed which enables seedling establishment under forest stands, which creates multi- aged stands
  - vegetative reproduction:
    - shallow root system makes species susceptible to windthrow, but layering (re-rooting from stems touching the ground) occurs in downed trees
  - mature trees are fire resistant due in part to bark that can be as thick as 10 inches
    - surviving trees provide seed source for new growth in burned areas
  - compounds in plant tissues defend against microbial (bacterial and fungal) infections
