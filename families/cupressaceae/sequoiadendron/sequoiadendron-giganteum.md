Other characteristics:
  - huge tree to 325 ft. (95 m) in height and ~30 ft. (12 m) in diameter
  - by volume, the largest tree in the world
  - spongy, fibrous, red bark
  - trunk buttressed at base
  - perfect conical shape
  - branches form a rounded crown towards the top with individual branches sweeping downwards with upturned ends
  - crown changes dramatically as it ages, from a simple conical crown of primary branches to a complex structure reflecting multiple episodes of epicormic branch formation, often recording damage from past episodes of drought, fire, and storm
  - branchlets, not leaves, shed, so look on ground under tree

Relevant info:
  - rapid growing tree
  - very long lived (2,000-3,000 years)
  - does not take root compaction well in managed landscapes
  - formerly included in *Sequoia* as *S. gigantea* (Lindley)
  - separation of the two genera is based on differences in the development of *Sequoia* and *Sequoiadendron* seed cones
  - California state tree, in addition to *[Sequoia sempervirens](../../sequoia/sequoia-sempervirens/)*

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - Native to mixed conifer forests in isolated groves on western slopes of Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, 900-2700 m elevation
  - found in humid environments with dry summers and snowy winters
  - evergreen leaves allow photosynthesis year-round, and conical shape maximizes light absorption throughout the day and all seasons
  - vegetative reproduction -- may sprout from buds in trunk when old branches are lost to fire or breakage
  - pollination:
    - by wind occurs in late winter or spring when the female conelets are only 2-3 times larger than the twig
    - fertilization does not occur until summer, by which time the cones are almost full size
  - seed dispersal:
    - via gravity and insect and rodent activity
    - cones also fall to ground and may open over several years or two decades
    - >300,000 seeds released from a single tree
  - seed germination -- seeds dropped just before the first snow or just as the snow melts may have the best chance of germinating and becoming successfully established
  - fire-resistance:
    - deeply furrowed bark can be up to 60 cm thick and is fire-resistant
    - heat from fire causes cones to open, dispersing their seeds on the wind
    - post-fire, seedlings establish in layer of ash in cleared areas
  - herbivore & microbial protection -- compounds in wood and leaves include tannins (including antimicrobial catechin), terpenes, resins, waxes
  - nutrient absorption -- mycorrhizal association aids nutrient and water uptake in forest environments with a lot of competition for resources
  - can withstand drier conditions than *[Sequoia sempervirens](../../sequoia/sequoia-sempervirens/)*
