Other characteristics:
  - rhizomatous shrub (may be considered aggressive by gardeners and foresters)
  - deciduous
  - peeling bark on older stems, slender thorns on younger

Relevant info:
  - important food for Native Americans and First Nations, though mushier and less sweet than other native berries

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - crest in Washington, Alaska south to California, east to Idaho.
  - found in lowland moist woods and swamps to mid- elevations in the mountains
  - often abundant along stream edges and avalanche tracks, as well as on river terraces, gravel bars and in forest openings
  - often forming dense, clonal thickets via rhizomes
  - vegetative reproduction:
    - via rhizomes and layering
    - can spread as downward arching aerial canes become buried by litter, subsequently root, and produce new aerial shoots
  - pollination:
    - by hummingbirds
    - flower nectar provides food for pollinators, such as bees and other insects, as well as rufous hummingbird.
  - seed dispersal:
    - consumption by birds and large mammals, especially, disperse seeds after exposing them to acids that weaken seed coat and aid water absorption and germination
    - long period of fruiting (2 months) increases chances of seed dispersal by animals
  - wildlife:
    - food and cover for birds and mammals
    - leaves and young shoots are eaten by deer, elk, mountain goats, moose
    - stem, foliage, cambium, and bark eaten by rabbits, porcupine, and beaver
    - fruit eaten by coyote, black bear, grizzly bear, and many smaller mammals, as well as a variety of birds, including the ruffed grouse, northern bobwhite, and various thrushes and towhees
    - seeds consumed by mice and other small rodents
  - succession -- responds rapidly to disturbance, establishing as a pioneer species and spreads via rhizomes
  - tolerates low-oxygen conditions -- vegetative reproduction through rhizomes enables species to spread in low-oxygen conditions of wetlands
  - resistant to fire:
    - following fire, re-sprouts vigorously from the stump, root crown, stem base or root stock, and from a dense network of rhizomes below ground
    - seeds remain viable in soil for years and germinate in large numbers after fire
  - shade tolerant -- vegetative reproduction maintains colonies in shaded forest understory
  - develops on nitrogen-rich soils
