Fruit:
  - drupe
  - nearly spherical
  - 4-8 mm long
  - purple-black
  - warty
  - may be waxy

Other characteristics:
  - evergreen shrub

Relevant info:
  - grows well in sandy soil
  - fruit pulp yields wax used to scent candles and perfumes
  - fruit of some specimen of this species have lower content of aromatic wax and may appear purple-black rather than white
  - formerly known as *Myrica californica*
    - originally assigned to *Myrica* by Chamisso, German botanist who published materials on the flora of Mexico with colleague Schlechtendal, in 1831
    - re-classified to *[Morella](../)*, another species in the same family, by American botanist R. L. Wilbur in 1994

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to the Pacific Coast and coastal valleys from southern British Columbia to central California
  - in Washington, southern half of the outer coast
  - at low eleveations (<500 m)
  - found in sandy, moist areas
  - coastal conifer forests, bogs, sand dunes, stream banks, wet meadows, marshes, low, moist hillsides
  - vegetative reproduction -- re-sprouts from root crown following disturbance, resulting in multi-stemmed shrub growth-form
  - pollination by wind
  - seed dispersal by birds, which remove the wax coating as the fruits pass through their guts, which permits germination
  - drought tolerance & herbivore/insect protection -- waxy substance in leaves that is produced by glands helps prevent water loss and protects against microorganism infection and insect herbivory
  - herbivory and microbial defense -- aromatic compounds released when leaves are crushed serve as defenses against herbivory and microbial infection
  - tolerates low nutrient conditions (e.g., sandy substrates):
    - hosts nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules
    - evergreen leaves maximize investment in photosynthetic structures
  - fire tolerance via re-sprouting from root crown
  - adapted to wetlands:
    - closely related species (*Myrica gale*) produces proportionately more below-ground than above-ground tissue when soil is saturated
    - major lateral roots become semi-vertical with increasing water-table depth
    - root nodules are more abundant in wetter soils
    - nodule roots extend above surface of saturated soils, which increases oxygen uptake
