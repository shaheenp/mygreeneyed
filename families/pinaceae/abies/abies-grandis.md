*grandis* -- Latin for 'grand' or 'great', as named by botanist David Douglas in the early 1800s because of its height and diameter

Native range: W. North America

Leaves:
  - needles flat
  - 3/4--1" long (~up to 2")
  - shiny
  - tips are blunt to notched
  - needles are of different lengths
  - needles on branches are two-ranked and slightly pointed downward
  - two white stomatal bands on underside of leaf
  - spread so horizontally that top and bottom of twig usually visible (like scalp through parted hair)
  - pungent balsam or tangerine aroma emitted by crushed leaves
  - retained on tree for 7 years on average

Cones:
  - female cones:
    - upright
    - deciduous
    - 3--4" tall
    - high in the crown where they fall apart through autumn
    - production begins at 20--50 years of age
    - winged seeds
  - pollen and ovulate cones begin development during the summer and go through a period of winter dormancy before pollination, fertilization, and seed production the 2nd spring and summer

Bark:
  - grayish to light brown (older)
  - smooth to shallowly ridged
  - layer beneath outer bark is reddish

Other characteristics:
  - evergreen tree
  - tall, straight, and thin (over 200 ft.)
  - short branches on a very tall tree
  - very regular branching pattern results from cruciform (arranged in a cross patter) buds
  - in young trees, multiple branches emerge in a whorl each year from a single height (position) on trunk)
  - twigs -- opposite branching
  - pubescent young twigs

Relevant info:
  - fastest growing of all North American firs
  - lifespan may reach 250--300 years

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to Vancouver Island, British Columbia south to California on both sides of the Cascades
  - scattered areas in the mountains east to Montana
  - found in dry to moist coniferous forests, usually with Douglas-fir, river flats to fairly dry slopes, from sea level to mid-elevations in the mountains
  - grows most successfully on streamside alluvium and deep, nutrient-rich valley bottoms
  - mature grand fir forests are usually biologically diverse
  - tolerates range of moisture:
    - well-developed tap root on dry sites reaches deep water tables
    - on moist sites shallow lateral roots prevail so that oxygen can more easily be absorbed
    - unlike seedlings, established trees are drought tolerant due to deep tap root, though moisture is limiting in its southernmost distribution
    - tolerant of fluctuating water tables and floods experienced in floodplains.
  - pollinated by wind
  - seed dispersal -- winged seeds are wind-dispersed a few hundred feet from the parent
  - fire:
    - resistant to low- and moderate-severity fires:
      - bark on mature trees that is 2 inches thick
      - germination of seeds is best on ash or mineral soil cleared by fire, except dry sites and those absorbing heat after blackened by fire
    - sensitive to fire:
      - relatively thin bark, low and dense branching habit, retention of leaves for years, and high surface-to-volume ratio of foliage
  - shade tolerance:
    - moderate
    - seedlings continue to establish until canopy closes
    - large leaf area to capture light
    - low light-saturation point, so plant reaches maximum photosynthetic rate with relatively low light
    - two-ranked needle arrangement maximizes horizontal orientation of leaves
    - evergreen habit permits photosynthesis all year
  - herbivory defense:
    - tree secretes pitch (oleoresin) to seal wounds created by insect attack
      - this terpenoid-containing substance (oleoresin) is toxic to both larvae of invading insects and their pathogenic fungal symbionts
