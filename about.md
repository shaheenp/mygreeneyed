title: About | MyGreenEyeD
---

This site was started initially for a "MyGreenEyeD" project for ESRM 331, Landscape Plant Recognition, at the University of Washington. The purpose of the project was to create a place to document the species we learn in class (Field Days) and species we find & identify ourselves (Discovery Log). The idea was to construct our project in a way where we were learning about the species while working on it and creating it in a way that it serves as a field guide/guide book for future reference and expansion.

My approach to the project was to create a catalog of all the families, genera, and species I was learning that was easily navigable and extensible. I wanted to create it in a way that it was able to be easily expanded upon and modified after the course and project were over if I thought of a new approach. That is why I went with a digital form---this website. It is easy to modify, whether it is the organization, style, way information is displayed, etc..

I started learning about plants from looking up individual species on Wikipedia. I would then follow the classification links in the species' info box to explore the families and genera. I wanted to create a similar experience with this website.

Most of the information on this website was taken from handouts meticulously put together by Caren Crandell, the professor for ESRM 331 in Spring 2020. Many thanks to Caren.
