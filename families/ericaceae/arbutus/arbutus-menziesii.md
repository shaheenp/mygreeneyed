Relevant info:
  - fungal disease affecting many plants
  - called *madrono* (Spanish for 'strawberry tree') by Father Juan Crespi, chronicler of the overland Portola expedition of 1769 to find the 'lost bay' of Monterey
    - he named it for its resemblance to Mediterranean strawberry tree (*[A. unedo](../arbutus-unedo/)*)

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to SW coastal British Columbia south to California
  - in Washington, west of the Cascades
  - found on dry, sunny, often rocky sites (such as bluffs), frequently with coarse-textured soils
  - low to middle elevations (915 m.)
  - typically associated with Douglas-fir and Garry oak
  - pollination -- bees are attracted to nectaries at the base of the corolla
  - seed dispersal -- fruits attract birds (such as mourning dove and band-tailed pigeon), mule deer, and rodents, which aid in dispersal
  - vegetative regeneration:
    - at base of stem is woody, globe-shaped, underground regenerative organ known as a burl (short branchlets fused into a mass of wood with dormant buds that can sprout when the main trunk is injured or destroyed)
    - this ability contributes to fire and disease resilience.
  - drought tolerance:
    - thick, leathery, evergreen leaves prevent water loss
    - long-lived leaves conserve resources in nutrient-poor environments
  - adapted to low-nutrient & droughty conditions:
    - massive, wide-spreading root system is associated with mycorrhizae that aid absorption of water and nutrients
    - evergreen leaves help conserve nutrient resources
  - wind & drought tolerance -- large root system contributes to tolerance of onshore winds and drought
  - succession:
    - low resistance to fire due to thin bark that provides little insulation from radiant heat, which usually kills the cambium
    - however, species depends on periodic fire to eliminate or greatly reduce the [shade of] conifer overstory
    - species is usually absent from understory of mixed-evergreen forest in PNW due to shade intolerance
    - seeds remain dormant and viable for >20 yrs in the soil
    - germination is most successful in light (i.e., open rather than shaded conditions)
  - wildlife:
    - leaves provide winter forage for Sitka black-tailed deer
    - berries are important food for deer, birds (such as dark-eyed junco, fox sparrow, varied thrush, band-tailed pigeon), and other small mammals because they are produced in large quantities and may persist on the tree in winter, when alternative food sources are limited
