Other characteristics:
  - deciduous
  - flowers and hips are significantly larger than in most closely related species

Relevant info:
  - widespread, polymorphic, hexaploid species
  - hips, leaves, and bark had many medicinal uses in Native American culture in PNW

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native from coastal Alaska south to northern California, and eastward in the Rocky Mtns from Montana to New Mexico
  - found in open or wooded areas, shorelines, rocky coasts and bluffs, meadows, thickets, streamside areas, roadsides, clearings, edges of woods
  - at low to moderate elevations in the mountains (0--300 m.)
  - widely distributed throughout Washington
  - pollinated by bees
  - seeds are dispersed by birds and mammals
  - vegetative regeneration/reproduction:
    - sprouts from the root crown and spreads via rhizomes
    - forms thickets, especially in open (sunny) conditions
  - herbivory & microbial defense:
    - robust thorns on some but not all stems
    - sepals (bud cover) contain compounds (cyanogenic glycosides, tannins and terpenes) that deter herbivory and resist microbial infection
  - shade tolerant and can be abundant in forest understory but exhibits increased growth and fruit production with increasing light
  - moderately dry conditions â€“ deep roots help plant handle fluctuating water tables
  - wildlife:
    - fruits remain on plant through winter and are eaten by deer, elk, bears, coyotes and squirrels, among other animals
    - squirrels, mice, beavers, and porcupines eat the twigs and leaves
    - thickets are used for nesting and escape-cover by birds and small mammals
