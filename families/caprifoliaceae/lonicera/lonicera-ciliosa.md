Other characteristics:
  - climbing, widely branching vine, sometimes reaching 6 m. in height
  - deciduous
  - hollow twigs

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - British Columbia south to Oregon, east to Montana
  - ranging throughout Washington
  - found in open to rather dense woods, thickets, from sea level to mid-elevations in the mountains
  - pollination -- nectar attracts hummingbirds, bees
  - herbivore defense -- berries appear to contain toxins (the literature is scarce, but they were not eaten by Native Americans, though children sucked the nectar from the flowers before seed set)
  - wildlife:
    - hosts several butterfly and moth species (i.e., eggs are laid and caterpillars feed exclusively on them)
    - birds eat fruit and disperse seed
