Other notes:
  - small shrub or tree to 20 ft.
  - ~thorny
  - mostly evergreen, can be deciduous
  - popular garden plant but several native species occur in the PNW
  - *C. thyrsifolius* and cultivar Puget Blue are common here
  - *C. gloriosus* (Point Reyes C.):
    - low and prostrate
    - blue flowers
    - dark green leaves
    - good in hot dry conditions

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - *C. thyrsiflorus* (Blue blossom, California lilac)
    - native from SW Oregon to Southern California
    - found in the Coastal Range foothills
  - *C. prostratus* (mahala mat, squawcarpet)
    - native to: east slope of the Cascades in Washington from Yakima County south; Washington south to California; east to Idaho and western Nevada
    - found in drier open woods, moderate to mid-elevations in the mountains
  - *C. sanguineus* (redstem ceanothus, Oregon teatree)
    - native to and widely distributed on both sides of the Cascades in Washington; BC to California, east to Idaho
    - found in moist to dry open woods, low to moderate elevations
  - deciduous:
    - *C. velutinus* (mountain balm, greasewood, sticky-laurel, tobacco-brush)
      - native to and widely distributed on both sides of the Cascades in Washington; BC to California, east to South Dakota and Colorado
      - found in moist to dry open forests, low to mid-elevations in the mountains
  - evergreen:
    - *C. integerrimus* (deerbrush)
      - native east of the Cascades in Washington along and near the Columbia; Washington south to Baja California
      - found in dry, open forests and open areas at low to moderate elevations on gentle to steep slopes
      - drought-deciduous (i.e., survives drought by dropping its leaves)
  - pollinated by hummingbirds, honey bees, and bumble bees
  - seed dispersal -- ripe seed is forcibly ejected from the capsule when the capsule dries and splits
  - tolerates low-nutrient levels -- a species of N-fixing bacterium, *Streptomyces*, inhabits *Ceanothus* root nodules, enabling the genus to handle low-nutrient conditions
  - fire/disturbance adapted:
    - regenerates after fire and herbivory by resprouting from root crown and/or stem
    - may spread laterally by layering
    - early successional species that establishes on sites after fire, landslide, or other stand-replacing event
    - N-fixing bacteria in root nodules provides essential nutrients in disturbed environments
    - primary means of re-establishment after fire is seeds, which are produced in abundance and may remain viable for over 20 years, until the hard seed coat is scarified by fire
    - establishment is best on bare mineral soil, such as that found after fire
