*Photinia* -- deried from the Greek word *photeinos* meaning "shining," in reference to the shiny leaves of some species

Native range: SE Asia

Leaves:
  - Alternate
  - typically simple
  - lanceolate with a short petiole
  - margin usually serrate
  - bright red new foliage (lasts through season), fade to a deep glossy green in 2-4 weeks
  - continual trimming of the ends of the shoots stimulates the plant to keep producing new leaves throughout the year

Flowers:
  - inflorescence:
    - small, white flowers in umbellate clusters
    - 10- 12 cm wide
  - 5 sepals, fused at base
  - 5 petals
  - many stamens
  - 2 styles (rarely 3-5)
  - unpleasant odor attracts flies as pollinators

Fruit:

Other characteristics:
  - trees to 45 ft. and shrubs
  - deciduous or evergreen

Relevant info:
  - fast-growing, tolerant of poor conditions, but subject to leaf blights
  - in SE U.S., where high humidity and moist conditions are prevalent, fungal leaf spot, *Entomosporium maculatum*, has been lethal to many hedges
  - two species sometimes grown, but most in the landscape are a hybrid of the species, *P. X fraseri*
    - hybrid name recognizes the Fraser Nursery in Birmingham, Alabama, where the hybrid originated in 1940
    - cross of Chinese *P. serrulata* (seed parent) and Japanese *P. glabra*

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native mostly to warm temperate Asia, from the Himalayas east to Japan and south to India and Thailand
  - shade tolerant:
    - evergreen leaves photosynthesize throughout the year, absorbing winter light when leaves are not present on deciduous trees in the over-story
    - concentration of photosynthetic pigments
    - increases in leaves in low light
    - in lower light, CO2 levels are increased via gas exchange through open stomates
    - light saturation point is lower and CO2 assimilation rate is higher in shaded conditions
    - longer petioles (leaf stems) in older leaves permits spacing of leaves that maximizes light capture
  - pollination -- unpleasant odor of flowers attracts dipteran pollinators (flies)
  - drought tolerant:
    - increased anthocyanin (water-soluble red-purple pigment) concentration aids water regulation in younger leaves
    - thicker older leaves retain water
    - stomata closure limits water loss (but also decreased photosynthesis)
    - in full sun, photosynthesis decreases during mid- day, which limits water loss when light is most intense
    - proline concentrations, which help prevent water loss, increase under drought conditions and salt exposure (in agricultural landscapes)
  - cold resistant -- leaves are resistant to cold, presumably because the solute concentration in cells decreases freezing temperature and prevents waters from leaving cells and contributing to extracellular ice crystals in freezing temps
