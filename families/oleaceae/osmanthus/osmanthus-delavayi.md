  - ovoid-shaped drupe
  - bluish-black

Relevant info:
  - good species for hedges
  - in China, members of *[Osmanthus](../)* flower in fall during harvest when the full moon is especially big
    - important during the mid-Autumn festival when Chinese celebrate the full moon with traditional Taoist legends about moon goddess Chang'e and her jade rabbit, Yutu, while enjoying osmanthus cake, tea and wine
    - young men had to study for their imperial exams each fall in hopes of "plucking the osmanthus from the Moon Palace," as in a legend

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to south central China (Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan)
  - found in montane regions (2100-3400 m) in ravines, thickets, mixed woods
  - shade tolerant:
    - under canopy, stems branch at longer intervals, resulting in more horizontal and vertical growth to capture light, and leaves are spread uniformly throughout branching structure to avoid self- shading and maximize light capture
    - evergreen leaves permit light absorption during much of the year
  - drought tolerant when mature:
    - waxy coating helps prevent loss of moisture from leaves
    - torus-bearing (impermeable layer consisting of thick cell wall), pitted tracheary elements extend throughout the vasculature and help maintain pressure within the vessel during drought stress or adjacent tissue damage
  - pollination -- sweetly fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees, which drink nectar and carry pollen back to hives as food for developing bees
  - fruit attracts animals that disperse seeds
  - compounds in leaves defend against herbivory and microbial infection
