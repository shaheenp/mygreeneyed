Fruit:
  - dry capsules

Other characteristics:
  - shrub to 8--9 ft.
  - evergreen
  - flowers early in spring
  - new stem/leaf growth orange to red (some cultivars are selected for this)
  - many (>50) cultivars:
    - 'Forest Flame' -- new leaves brilliant red
    - 'Variegata' -- leaves with white variegated margins
    - dwarf cultivars

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - grows in mountain thickets and forest understory in SE China, Taiwan & Japan
  - very shade tolerant:
    - energy investment is mostly in photosynthesizing structures (leaves) rather than woody stems
    - evergreen leaves capture light when deciduous oak and beech over-story does not have leaves
  - somewhat drought tolerant:
    - stomate regulate water loss
    - reduced demand for water via decrease in photosynthetic rate
  - herbivore defense:
    - leaves and nectar contain toxic compounds (grayanotoxin) that induce burning, vomiting, and a coma in some animals and protect the plant form herbivory (e.g., from gypsy moths and cotton bullworm)
  - coevolution:
    - some insects can handle the toxins and take advantage of them: a geometrid moth was found to store toxic compounds originating from the larval host plant (*P. japonica*), and these served to protect the moth from ingestion by house lizards
