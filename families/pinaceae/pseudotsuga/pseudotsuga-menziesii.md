  - yields more timber than any other tree in North America
  - straight trunks are made into telephone poles and used for ship masts
  - Oregon's state tree

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - British Columbia to California, east to Alberta and Colorado
  - found in moist to dry areas from sea level to mid- elevations in the mountains
  - fire resistance -- on mature trees, very thick (4-12"), corky bark, which enables trees to survive moderate surface fires
  - pollination by wind
  - seed dispersal:
    - seeds have a relatively large, single wing and are primarily dispersed by wind and gravity
    - when trees destroyed by fire, seeds arrive via the wind
    - stand-destroying disturbance (wildfire, logging, extensive wind-throw) initiates a new cohort of seedlings birds and small mammals also aid dispersal
  - not tolerant of shade - as tree matures, it sheds lower, shaded branches and concentrates needle production on upper branches exposed to direct sunlight
  - succession:
    - first conifer to establish on drier sites
    - very long-lived species, so 1,000 years may pass before a shade-tolerant species overcomes this pioneer
  - herbivore defense -- chemical compounds, such as tannins and terpines, in leaves
  - wildlife:
    - seeds are important food sources for small mammals (voles, chipmunks) and songbirds (sparrows, finches)
    - Douglas squirrels also eat pollen cones, inner bark, and young needles
