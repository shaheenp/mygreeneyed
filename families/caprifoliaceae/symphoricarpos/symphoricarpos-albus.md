Other characteristics:
  - deciduous shrub
  - 2--6 ft. tall (tallest in riparian areas)
  - densely branched
  - erect, thin branches
  - twigs delicate and brown

Relevant info:
  - sensitive to trampling and soil compaction
  - berries are poisonous to humans, causing vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and in severe cases, unconsciousness
  - in PNW, also known as *S. albus* var. *laevigatus* (from Latin for "to make smooth, slippery")
    - plants of this variety are taller and the fruits are larger than var. *albus*

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native for, Alaska to California, east to Wyoming.
  - widely distributed throughout Washington
  - found in dry to moist, open forests, thickets, rocky slopes, river terraces, ravines, along beaches (Alaska and Haida Gwaii/Queen Charlotte Islands)
  - low to middle elevations in the mountains
  - pollination:
    - by bees
    - also self-compatible (i.e., plant can successfully fertilize itself)
  - seed dispersal:
    - fruit attract birds and small mammals that aid in dispersal
    - fruit often remains on shrubs through winter
  - vegetative reproduction -- spreads by rhizomes
  - fire resistance -- survives fire of low to moderate and even highest intensity by sprouting from underground rhizomes after top of the plant is killed
  - herbivore defense -- contains alkaloids that inhibit growth of insects
  - competition -- tissues contain allelopathic compounds released to the environment that prevent other species from establishing in the same area
  - tolerant of dry, low nutrient conditions -- associations with mycorrhizae aid absorption of water and nutrients
