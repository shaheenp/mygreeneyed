Fruit:
  - nuts sharply triangular-shaped in 1" long hard woody soft-spined 4-lobed husk
  - borne singly or in pairs
  - bitter nuts are edible, but toxic when eaten unripe and raw

Other characteristics:
  - tree 30--40 (50) m.
  - smooth, gray bark "elephant hide" look to older trees
  - can have huge trunk (can maintain high growth rate until late maturity)
  - branches to the ground
  - leaves russet & golden-bronze in fall
  - leaves emerge late spring (May)
  - cultivar 'purpurea' deep black-red leaves

Relevant info:
  - lifespan -- 150--300 (550) years
  - prone to aphids in PNW
  - fine-grained hard wood is used for boatbuilding, flooring, stairs, furniture, piano pinblocks, wooden spoons, etc.
  - unusual annual pattern of growth:
    - large terminal bud erupts into a shoot 45–60 cm long in early May and hangs drooping and grey with silky hairs
    - in July, the terminal bud adds an additional 30--45 cm to its length
    - shoot straightens by September
  - hybridizes with *Fagus orientalis*, which is found in the same range though often at lower elevations (e.g., valleys)

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native southern Scandinavia to Sicily, from Northern Spain in the west to northwest Turkey in the east
  - grows in humid climates with precipitation well distributed throughout the year
  - in southern part of range (Spain, Sicily), where drought becomes a limiting factor, found at cooler elevations of >1,000 m., and as high as 2,000 m.
  - found on hillsides and other well-drained places
  - grows well on soft soils that root system can easily penetrate
  - optimal growth is in humid soils situated on calcareous or volcanic parent rocks
  - abundant leaf production adds organic matter to soils
  - sexual reproduction:
    - as shade-tolerant species, begins flowering when ~40 years in full sun to 60--80 years in dense stands
    - masting every 2--8 yrs depending on region in Europe (i.e., periodic synchronous production of very large seed crops; sufficient seed remains for the initiation of a new crop of seedlings after seed predators have become completely satiated)
  - pollinated by wind
  - self-incompatible
  - seed dispersal -- birds and small mammals, such as squirrels, play major part in seed dispersal by hiding the seeds and failing to retrieve all of them
  - vegetative regeneration:
    - produces suckers from roots, produces shoots from trunk (or stump) if cut down, broken or destroyed by fire
    - branches may produce adventitious roots and new shoots, especially when they are forced to the ground by snow pressure near the alpine limits of tree growth
  - herbivore defense:
    - nuts contain saponic glycoside, which confers a bitter taste, reducing palatability, and interferes with digestion
    - leaves contain isoconiferin and syringin, which protect against insect attack
  - low-nutrient conditions -- association with mycorrhizae facilitates nutrient uptake
  - very shade tolerant:
    - seedlings grow beneath parent trees and eventually replace them
    - morphological modifications in response to low light include larger but thinner leaves in shaded conditions, which maximizes light capture and minimizes investment in photosynthesizing structure
    - physiological modifications include higher photosynthetic capacity in shade leaves based on unit mass compared to sun leaves, though lower capacity based on unit area
    - under closed canopies, a decrease in leaf number per shoot, an increase in leaf size and regular leaf dispersion all tend to diminish the within‐shoot shading
    - in shaded environments, tree adopts a monolayer strategy (i.e., large horizontal regularly distributed leaves spread in a single layer to maximize light capture) vs. in sunny conditions, in which it adopts a multilayer strategy that enables an optimization of the light levels over the whole canopy due to an increase of light penetration, and the leaves held more erectly
    - biomass is preferentially allocated to radial growth rather than height, especially in low light fluxes
  - competition -- canopy of mature trees casts shade so dense that no other tree can develop beneath it
  - wildlife:
    - deer browse young stands
    - nuts are important source of food for several animals and birds, including squirrels, woodpigeons, woodpeckers, and jays
