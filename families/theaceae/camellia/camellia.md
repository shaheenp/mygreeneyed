Fruit:
  - capsule

Other notes:
  - trees to 45 feet or shrubs
  - evergreen
  - over 2,000 cultivars (Dirr [1998] states that the situation is confused "to the point of hopelessness")
  - *C. sinensis* is the source of tea
  - *C. sasanqua* is an early bloomer
  - *C. japonica* has blossom rot in PNW climate
  - *C. Xwilliamsii* is better suited (cross of *C. saluenensis* x *C. japonica* produced by JC Williams in the early 1930s)
  - *Camellia* refers to Georg Joseph Camel (1661-1706), a German Jesuit missionary to the Philippines who was noted for his work on plants in the Eastern hemisphere
  - Alabama's state flower

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - example in the WA Arboretum: *Camellia sasanqua*
    - native to Japan where it is found in forest clearings and on grassy slopes on mountainsides
  - drought tolerant:
    - leathery leaves retain water
    - thick canopy of leaves shades and cools roots
  - shade tolerant:
    - in shady conditions, leaves are thinner, which provides light capturing surface area but limits the total investment in photosynthesizing structures
    - stomata are not as dense as is found on leaves in full sun, since water regulation is not as important
  - pollination by birds and bees
  - herbivory defense -- leathery leaves protect against insect herbivory
  - microbial infection defense -- protected by numerous compounds, including flavonoids
