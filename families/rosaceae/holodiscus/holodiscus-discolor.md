  - alternate
  - simple
  - dull green
  - hairy on upper surface
  - paler and hairy on lower surface

Flowers:
  - inflorescence -- pyramidal cluster 4--8" long
  - small white/creamy flowers in dense, terminal pyramidal, lilac-like clusters 10--17 cm. long
  - dead flower clusters/fruit remain on plants over winter 5-merous

Fruit:
  - achenes (dry one-seeded indehiscent fruit with the seed distinct from the fruit wall)
  - tiny (2 mm)
  - hairy
  - persist into winter as dry brown hanging remnants

Other characteristics:
  - deciduous shrub to 10 ft. tall
  - multi-stemmed
  - arching form
  - young stems ridged, older ones with brownish peeling bark

Relevant info:
  - according to U.S. Forest Service, "'most widespread and possibly the most abundant flowering shrub' in coniferous forests of northeastern Washington and northern Idaho"
  - called "ironwood" because wood is hard, especially after heating and used for making tools (e.g., bows, arrows, pegs)
  - Meriwether Lewis (Lewis & Clark Expedition) made the first scientific collection of oceanspray on the banks of the Clearwater River in Idaho
  - common name "oceanspray" is derived from masses of loose, creamy plumes

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to British Columbia to south California, east to the Rocky Mountains
  - in Washington, occurring on both sides of the Cascades crest
  - found in gravelly soil in open, dry to moist woods, thickets, clearings, ravine edges, coastal bluffs
  - at low to moderate elevations in the mountains (0--2,150 m.)
  - seral and old-growth conifer, seral and old- growth hardwood, mixed-riparian, and mixed-shrubland types
  - pollination by insects
  - flowering is relatively late, which may provide competitive advantage for attracting pollinators
  - seed dispersed by wind and animals
  - vegetative regeneration:
    - sprouts from the root crown after fire and other top-killing events
    - may spread by layering
  - herbivore/pathogen defense:
    - compounds in tissues have antifungal, antiviral, and cytotoxic properties
    - tannins and flavonoids deter herbivory
  - drought tolerance:
    - adapted to dry sites and drought by shutting down or slowing its rate of transpiration
    - large leaf area may partially compensate for low water transpiration rates in summer
    - association with mycorrhizal fungi facilitates water uptake
  - tolerance of low nutrient soils -- association with mycorrhizae facilitates nutrient uptake
  - wildlife:
    - elk and deer browse oceanspray during winter
    - yellow-bellied marmot burrows are often near oceanspray
    - nesting habitat, cover, and food for a variety of non-game birds and mammals
