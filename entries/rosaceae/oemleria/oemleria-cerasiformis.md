*Oemleria* -- refers to Herr Oemer of Dresden, Germany, who supplied American plants to the German botanist H.G.L. Reichenbach in the mid-1800s

*cerasiformis* -- shaped like a cherry, referring to the fruit

Leaves:
  - alternate
  - simple
  - entire
  - leaves narrowly oblong-lanceolate to oblanceolate
  - light greenish-yellow
  - smell like cucumber

Flowers:
  - dioecious, but sometimes bisexual flowers on plant
  - pendulous inflorescence (raceme)
  - 5 sepals & petals
  - male flowers -- 15 stamens in 3 whorls
  - female flowers -- 5 carpels & styles
  - small greenish white

Fruit:
  - thin-freshed drupe
  - bitter but edible
  - ripens to black (various colors as it ripens from yellow to red-purple to purple-black)

Other characteristics:
  - shrub to small tree, to 9 ft
  - deciduous
  - bark is purplish brown and bitter
  - no thorns
  - stems have chambered pith
  - one of the earliest bloomers in spring, flowers produced before leaves

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - dry to moist open woods, streambanks, at low elevations
  - in WA, west of the Cascades and along the Columbia River Gorge
  - common understory species, adapted through timing
    - leaves emerge early, absorbing sunlight before overstory trees produce leaves that shade
  - pollination -- blooms in late winter/early spring, producing nectar that attracts hummingbirds, moths, butterflies, native bees, and other pollinators
  - seed dispersal -- animals (e.g., birds, squirrels, foxes, coyotes, raccoons, skunk, deer, bear) eat the fruit and disperse seeds
  - fruit's stone, or pit, contains cyanoglucosides (bitter, toxic compounds) as an herbivory defense
  - adapted to low O<sub>2</sub> soils -- conspicuous orange lenticels in stems provide access to O<sub>2</sub> even if roots are in saturated soils
  - reproduce vegetatively by root suckering (new shoots produced from roots)
