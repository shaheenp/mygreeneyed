Other characteristics:
  - tree 50-90 ft. tall (up to 130 ft. in its native habitat)
  - may live 700-1,200 years
  - horizontal, upward-arching branches appear in symmetrical whorls around the trunk with rope-like branchlets

Relevant info:
  - slow growing
  - names refers to the indigenous people who eat the large seeds in the part of Chile in which it is native
  - seeds (*pinones*) are edible and reminiscent of pine nuts
  - Archibald Menzies (naturalist for Capt. Vancouver) was served some nuts in dessert while dining with the governor of Chile
    - he collected a few and germinated some on the voyage home
  - common name reportedly comes from a comment made in the mid-1800s in England where an observer of a specimen tree growing in Cornwall remarked that it would puzzle a monkey to climb that tree
  - national tree of Chile, where the species is endangered and therefore protected

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to woodland volcanic slopes up to 6,000 feet in elevation in the Andes Mountains in Chile and Argentina, including dry sites at high elevations or on thin rocky substrates
  - in its small home range, soils are derived from layers of volcanic ash, some <2,000 years old, emanating from a chain of recently active andesitic (igneous rock) volcanoes
  - summers are very dry, with most precipitation falling during colder months
  - vegetative reproduction -- suckering from roots
  - pollination by wind
  - seed dispersal:
    - large seeds are not dispersed far, but are shade-tolerant and able to establish beneath parent trees
    - pattern may result in clumps
  - adapted to fire:
    - thick bark
    - protected terminal buds on branches
    - epicormic buds that sprout after fire damaged or other injury (i.e., buds lie dormant beneath the bark until/unless active shoots higher up the plant are damaged)
    - in one study, trees >30 cm in diameter survived fire, but different intensities may yield different outcomes
  - shade tolerant:
    - seedlings and root suckers establish beneath other species after fire
    - developmental increase in self-shading is largely offset by allocation changes which increase leaf area ratio as seedlings grow bigger
    - relatively large seeds do not disperse far and may establish under the shade of a parent tree surviving fire
  - tolerant of salt-laden winds in maritime climates
  - adapted to low nutrient conditions:
    - evergreen leaves preserve or extend investment in photosynthetic structures
    - nitrogen is re-absorbed from senescing leaves
    - association with mycorrhizal fungi aids absorption of nitrogen and, especially, of phosphorus
  - herbivore defense:
    - spiny leaves deter herbivores, especially in seedlings
    - compounds (including diterpenes) in resin deter herbivores and microbial infestation
