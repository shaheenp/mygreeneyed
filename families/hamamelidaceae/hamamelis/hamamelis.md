*hama* -- at the same time (Greek)

*milo* -- "apple" or "fruit" (Greek), reference to flowers and fruit appearing on the plant at the same time, since fruit from previous season ripens when flowers of the current season are expanding (especially for fall-flowering species such as *H. virginiana*)

*witch-hazel* -- English translation of Greek name (amamilis) used for Hippocrates for medlar, *Mespilus germanica* Linnaeus, which looks like a large rosehip

Native range: E. Asia, E. North America

Leaves:
  - alternate
  - simple
  - short petiole
  - base oblique
  - margin deeply undulate or serrate
  - palmate and pinnate veins on same leaf
  - parallel veins assymmetric at base (all the way up on many)
  - secondary veins go all the way to the margins
  - deciduous stipules
  - ~5--6" across

  - 4-lobed capsule
  - fuzzy
  - splits open to eject 2 seeds

Other characteristics:
  - shrubs or small trees to 35 ft.
  - spreading form
  - deciduous
  - buds brown and fuzzy
  - bark gray
  - nice fall color
  - flowers before leaves, usually in late winter/early spring
  - some species -- dead leaves persis

Other notes:
  - *H. mollis* (Chinese witch-hazel) introduced into cultivation in English in 1879 from seed collected in China by Charles Maries, British plant explorer
  - WA Arboretum collection includes: *H. japonica*, *H. mollis* & *H. virginiana*

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - *H. mollis* is native to Central China
  - *H. virginiana* is native to the mountains, piedmont, and coastal plain of Eastern North America, particularly woodlands, forest margins, and stream banks
  - shade tolerant:
    - pronounced horizontal orientation of branches/twigs and leaves to capture maximum light
    - relatively thin leaves minimize investment required for maximum photosynthesizing area
  - vegetative reproduction: spreads vegetatively via suckers (stems produced from roots) or stolons (modified stems growing horizontally on the ground)
  - pollination: flowers are pollinated by winter-flying noctuid moths
  - seed dispersal:
    - each (dehiscent) seed capsule splits open in the growing season of the following year, exploding the 1--2 black seeds within up to 30 ft
    - some dispersal by birds
  - wildlife:
    - wild turkeys eat the seeds of this plant, and white-tailed deer browse the leaves
    - birds, such as ruffed grouse, white-tailed deer, beaver, and cotton-tailed rabbit eat the fruit of *H. virginiana*
  - herbivore defense - active compounds (tannins, glycosides) in leaves prevent herbivory and enable this species to become a dominant understory species in eastern U.S. forests
