*arctos* -- bear (Greek) (animal that often eats the fruits)

*staphyle* -- bunch of grapes (Greek) (in reference to the fruits, in grape-link clusters)

*uva* -- grape (Latin)

*ursi* -- bear (Latin)

Native range: North Eurasia, North America

  - slightly revolute (rolled backwards)
  - glabrous (smooth/no pubescence)
  - 0.5-0.75" long

Flowers:
  - inflorescence -- cluster on short stalks (terminal racemes)
  - flowers small, nodding, pendulous
  - 5 petals, fused, urn shaped

  - 8-10 stamen

Fruit:
  - berry
  - small (1/3-1/2")
  - red

Other characteristics:
  - red stems
  - prostrate shrub
  - evergreen

Relevant info:
  - sunny areas, drought tolerant
  - "kinnikinnick" -- Algonquin word meaning *smoking* mixture
    - Native Americans and later early pioneers smoked dried leaves (alone or mixed with other leaves, tobacco, and/or the dry inner bark of red osier dogwood) in pipes
  - Meriwether Lewis described fruits in 1806 to be "tasteless and insipid"
  - example cultivars:
    - 'Massachusetts' from seed collected in Massachusetts
    - 'Vancouver Jade' from Victoria, BC

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - Alaska south to CA and New Mexico, east to the Atlantic Coast; circumboreal
  - Coastal bluffs and prairies, rocky balds, dry subalpine meadows, and dry coniferous forest
  - nectar in flowers attracts pollinators (hummingbirds, bees, thrips)
  - mycorrhizal associations aid drought and low nutrient tolerance
  - leathery leaves last, which helps conserve nutrients in nutrient-poor soils
  - fire tolerant -- latent buds on the horizontal stems and dormant buds on the stem base or root crown that allow sprouting of surviving plants or root stems after fire; hard-coated seeds persist in the seedback and help population recover after fire
  - fruits resistant to bacteria and fungi but attract animals, which aid in seed dispersal
