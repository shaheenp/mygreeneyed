Fruit:
  - drupe
  - red
  - not commonly seed on cultivated specimen

Other characteristics:
  - shrubs to 2-3 ft.
  - evergreen
  - blooms early in spring (hence its common name)

Relevant info:
  - poisonous
  - 'Marginata' is a popular cultivar
    - leaves edged with white or yellow
  - close cousin *Daphne laureola* (spurge laurel) is invasive in OR, BC & WA, including UW's Union Bay Natural Area, where students recently removed it from restoration sites
  - described in Chinese literature and pharmacopoeia for a thousand years and was depicted on a Japanese scroll in 1309

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native origin obscure, probably China or Japan, but now widely cultivated in China
  - shade tolerant -- evergreen leaves permit light absorption all year round
  - drought tolerant:
    - thick, leathery leaves retain moisture
    - torus-bearing (impermeable layer consisting of thick cell wall), pitted tracheary elements extend throughout the vasculature and help maintain pressure within the vessel during drought stress or adjacent tissue damage
  - pollination:
    - fragrant flowers attract pollinators, such as moths and bees that feed on nectar and pollen
    - early blooms have less competition for pollinators
  - herbivore defense:
    - all parts are poisonous if eaten
    - compound may be a diterpenoid (mezerein)
  - somewhat salt tolerant
