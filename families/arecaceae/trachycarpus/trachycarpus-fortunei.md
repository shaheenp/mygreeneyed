Other characteristics:
  - tree up to 60 ft. or shrub
  - unbranched trunk
  - fibrous hairs on trunk from persisting petioles

Relevant info:
  - fibers from the trunks of mature trees are stripped for weaving into a decorative hemp-like rope or for making brooms, mats, or cloth
  - one of the few palms that are hardy in PNW
  - dwarf cultivars exist

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to subtropical and temperate mountain forests of Central and Eastern China to N. Myanmar (Burma), where it grows 20-40' tall
  - heat adapted -- large leaves provide large photosynthetic surface, while deep incisions allow air flow that disperses heat
  - adapted to intense sunlight -- high light saturation point (i.e., point beyond which more light does not result in higher photosynthetic rate)
  - shade tolerant juveniles:
    - seedlings establish in shaded conditions
    - large leaf area maximizes light capture
    - longe (etiolated) petiole elevates leaves off the forest floor
  - tolerant of cold temperatures -- perhaps due in part to high levels of an enzyme (peroxidase) that facilitates production of compounds that reduce freezing temperature of the leaf tissue
  - seed dispersal -- fruits are eaten and distributed by birds
  - escaped ornamental is invasive in Japan and deciduous forests of southern Switzerland/Northern Italy, where it was planted in the gardens of new houses in the 1950s
  - evergreen habit allows plant to take advantage of available light before deciduous trees leaf out, espeically in forests without other evergreen species such as *Ilex aquifolium* (English holly) in Europe
  - climate change may be facilitating spread
  - forest restoration efforts in Europe and Japan require removal of this species
