Other characteristics:
  - evergreen shrubs to 4-6 ft. and 3-7 ft. wide
  - some cultivars may form large patches by suckering or seeding
  - may burn and turn yellow in the sun

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to SE Asia, including Central and SE China, Tibet, India, Vietnam, and the Phillipines & to SW Mexico
  - found in forests on mountain slopes, streamsides; 200-2,600 m elevation
  - vegetative reproduction with underground stems (suckers)
  - asexual reproduction -- displays apomixis
  - pollinated by bees
  - seed dispersal -- birds eat the fruit
  - herbivory defense -- leaves and roots contain steroidal alkaloids (chemical compounds that interfere with neurotransmitters in the nervous systems of animals, with effects similar to nerve gas)
  - shade tolerant probably due to low light saturation point
  - drought tolerant once established
    - leathery leaves retain water
    - adjusts osmotically to seasonal drought by concentrating solutes and reducing water potential, which allows plant to maintain turgor while under water stress
  - cold tolerant -- solute accumulation lowers tissue freezing point
