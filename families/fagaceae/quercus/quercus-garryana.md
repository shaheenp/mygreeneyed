Relevant info:
  - acorns eaten by Salish peoples of Puget Sound region after soaking to leach out the bitter tannins
  - losses of Garry oak woodlands range from 85--95% in the Pacific NW
    - primarily a result of European settlers that suppressed fires, altered land use, and introduced non-native species and heavy grazing

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - west of the Cascades, Vancouver Island to California
  - eastern foothills of the Cascades from Kittitas County south to the Columbia River
  - found in dry prairies and foothills to rocky bluffs
  - wooded slopes and montane coniferous forests
  - sometimes on deep, well-drained soil
  - low elevations (0--800 m.)
  - pollinated by wind
  - seed dispersal:
    - Douglas's squirrels carry acorns ~30 ft. before burying them
    - Steller's jays typically carried acorns 1,000--1,300 ft. (300--400 m.) into conifer-dominated sites before dropping or consuming then
    - Lewis's woodpeckers often transported acorns 100--200 ft. (30--50 m.) into Oregon white oak- or western juniper (*Juniperus occidentalis*)-dominated habitats before dropping or consuming them
  - vegetative regeneration & reproduction:
    - re-sprouts from roots, root crown and epicormic buds beneath bark
    - root and/or root crown sprouts are common following fire or cutting
    - epicormic sprouts occur following disturbance and canopy release from shading
  - fire adaptation:
    - persistence of Oregon white oak communities is dependent on periodic fire
    - Native Americans maintained open Oregon white oak stands through frequent fall burning
  - succession:
    - both a pioneer and a disturbance "climax" species
    - often the first tree "invader" on prairies, but without periodic disturbance (fire) it is replaced by conifers
  - herbivory defense -- tannins in leaves and acorns inhibit digestion in herbivores by interfering with the actions of enzymes involved with breaking down proteins
