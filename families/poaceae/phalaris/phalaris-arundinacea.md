Other characteristics:
  - robust perennial grass growing 2--6 ft. (2 m.) tall
  - long, scaly, pinkish rhizomes
  - hollow stems

Relevant info:
  - hyperaccumulator species capable of removing contaminants and excess nutrients through bioremediation
  - called 'canary grass' perhaps because *P. canariensis* is source of canary seed, or because genus was first described in Canary Island
  - Note: There is some debate about whether or not there was/is a native strain of this species, but it is listed as non- native according to botanists and evolutionary biologists of the UW Herbarium. Currently, it is a major threat in wetland areas and restoration sites, where it forms monocultures and prevents establishment of native species, so in this course we focus on the need for control.

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to Eurasia
  - found in wet places, usually where disturbed, especially along roads, streambanks, and open fields
  - scattered and often locally abundant, more common in the southern portion of PNW
  - at low to middle elevations around areas of human habitation or agricultural activity
  - dense rhizomatous mat prevents other species from establishing
  - vegetative reproduction:
    - rhizomes can extend over 10 ft/yr
    - extensive mat-producing system that prevents other species from becoming established
    - detached stems or rhizomes grow into new plants when in contact with bare soil
  - control:
    - combination of methods required
    - digging rhizomes (any remaining will continue to reproduce)
    - mowing/cutting, disking or tilling
    - burning can be pre-treatment for disking/tilling if conducted in the fall, but must occur earlier in the year to diminish growth (but generally not possible to get burn permits for earlier periods)
    - excavation (in prep for restoration sites), but all plant material must be disposed of off site or buried beneath 2 ft of soil
    - cover with shade cloth for two growing seasons
    - sheet mulching with cardboard plus 4 inches of wood chops plus dense (2--3 ft apart) planting of willow stakes (to create shade) has been successful in Puget Sound (at CUH!)
    - aquatic formulations of herbicides (glyphosates, imazapyr) with appropriate application methods (including repeat treatments) and permits
