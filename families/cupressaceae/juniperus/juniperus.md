Leaves:
  - awl-shaped, whorled and spreading or scale-like
  - often both leaf types on same plant

Cones:
  - dioceious
  - male cones:
    - small
    - catkin-like
    - wind pollinated
  - female cones:
    - 3-8 scales that fuse and become round and fleshy (berry-like) when ripe
    - covered with wax
    - purple/blue or black or occasionally red
    - usually <1/2" across
    - 1-3 seeds per scale
    - ripen and atten full size in the 1st autumn after pollination
    - berries mature by Nov. or Dec. of the 2nd year after pollination, then remain on the tree until March or April of the following spring

Other notes:
  - trees up to 90 ft. (usually smaller) or prostrate shrubs
  - evergreen
  - cones are used to flavor gin and smell like gin when crushed
  - wood of tree junipers used for drawers or to line closets (repel moths)
  - in PNW, native species include:
    - *J. communis* (common juniper)
    - *J. occidentalis* (western juniper)
    - *J. scopulorum* (Rocky Mountain juniper, seaside juniper), which lives 250-300+ years

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - *J. communis*:
    - found throughout much of Canada and the United States
    - dry, open lowland woods, gravelly ridges, outcrops, muskeg and open rocky slopes
    - from lowland bogs to mountain valleys to subalpine ridges and alpine tundra
  - *J. scopulorum*:
    - found in Puget Trough and SW British Columbia, south, east Cascades, to Oregon on coastal islands to inland valleys and lower mountains
  - *J. occidentalis*:
    - found east of the Cascades in desert foothills and lower mountains
  - adventitious root development can occur when branches come in contact with the ground or become buried (aid in water and nutrient intake)
  - pollination by wind
  - seed dispersal of common juniper - gravity, water, mammals, and especially birds (such as waxwings)
    - digestive (acidic) processes do not harm most juniper seeds and may enhance germination
  - herbivore/microbial defense -- compounds such as terpenoids and volatile oils deter herbivory by mule deer and microbial infection, though leaves are susceptible to rust and several borers and beetles
  - wildlife -- many bird species nest or roost in foliage
  - fire resistance:
    - resistant when mature, when they develop thicker bark and a more open crown, allowing them to survive surface fires if the low, spreading branches do not carry fire to the crown
    - volatile oils makes younger plants more flammable
    - post-fire re-establishment is by seed (no re-sprouting)
