  - alternate
  - deciduous
  - small
  - 3 leaflets when near the base of the branches, becoming simple above, pressed close to the branches

Flowers:
  - bright yellow, sometimes tinged with purple
  - typical legume flower (calyx cup-shaped, upper lip 2-lobed, the lower 3-lobed)
  - about 2 cm long
  - usually single in leaf axis

Fruit:
  - black, flattened pods
  - about 4 cm long
  - as the pod matures and dries, the two halves tend to warp in different directions, eventually snapping apart audibly and catapulting seeds

Other characteristics:
  - unarmed (no spines)
  - spindly
  - evergreen or deciduous
  - to 3 m. tall
  - branches green and strongly 5-angled
  - forms dense, monotypic stands which reduce wildlife habitat and hinder re-vegetation of upland sites and wetland buffers

Relevant info:
  - on Washington’s prohibited plants list (no buy, sell, or transport)
  - introduced to Vancouver Island in 1850 by Capt Grant, an immigrant from Scotland, from some seeds he acquired in Hawaii from the British consul
  - ‘broom’ is derived from Angle-Saxon *brom* meaning ‘foliage’
    - applied to shrubs that were used for making ‘besoms,’ which are bunches of twigs used as brooms

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to Europe
  - widespread noxious weed, usually where conditions are somewhat moist, but well adapted to drier soils in western WA (with its moist climate)
  - distributed widely throughout much of Washington, especially in lowlands west of the Cascades crest
  - British Columbia south to California
  - found in open sites, especially common on disturbed sites (e.g., along roads), but also invading natural meadows, thickets and open forest
  - at low elevations
  - N-fixing bacteria in roots enable the plant to colonize nutrient-poor and disturbed areas
  - herbivore defense -- produces toxic alkaloids that depress heart and nervous system
  - vegetative regeneration -- re-sprouts from stump or roots after cutting or fire
  - seed dispersal:
    - a plant may produce up to 10,000 seeds/year
    - pods halves snap apart, catapulting seeds away from plant
    - further dispersed by erosion, flowing water, and ants collecting food
    - seeds remain viable in soil from 5--60 years
  - control:
    - dig up or remove with a Weed Wrench, although the disturbed soil is then ideal for seed germination
    - older stems that are no longer green or those that are >2” can be cut during drought of late July/August, with less risk of re-sprouting, though seed germination should be monitored
    - large infestations on roadsides and other areas may require treatment with herbicide for 2 years, with monitoring for 10 years
