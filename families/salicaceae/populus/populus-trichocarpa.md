Other characteristics:
  - tree to 90 ft.
  - "Q-tip" shape
  - tallest, fastest-growing hardwood in the western US
  - lives 100--200 years
  - deciduous
  - ~brown pubescent branchlets
  - leaves have reddish resinous buds with a strong cinnamon scent
    - when leaves push through they pick up some of the resin and the leaf underside may appear to have orange blotches, especially in spring and early summer

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native to southern Alaska to southern California, east to the Rocky Mtns in Alberta and Wyoming
  - occurring throughout Washington
  - found in streambanks and moist woods, moist to wet sites, sea level to mid- elevations in the mountains (up to 5,000 ft in the Cascades)
  - forms extensive stands on islands and floodplains along major rivers and disturbed upland sites
  - vegetative regeneration:
    - re-sprouts from stumps following felling by beavers
    - following beaver activity or flood disturbance, branches of a fallen tree may establish new shoots that become trunks
    - cuttings of young branches (live stakes) can be used in restoration to plant this species in moist ground
    - regeneration in established forests is by root suckers or coppice sprouts
  - pollinated by wind
  - seed dispersal -- cottony hairs attached to seeds aid rapid disseminated by wind and water in late spring
  - Adapted to disturbance:
    - when moist mineral soil in floodplains is exposed, germination rates are high, particularly when moist conditions persist for a month after seed deposition
    - shade-intolerant seedlings rarely establish under parent trees
    - suitable conditions for seedling establishment sometimes occur (erratically) in approximately 5 to 10 year intervals
  - tolerant of winter flooding (while dormant)
    - but requires some aeration of soils during the growing season
    - shallow root system facilitates access to oxygen
  - tolerant of seasonal hotter, drier conditions -- resin covering leaves reduces water loss through transpiration
  - fire tolerance:
    - mature trees with thick bark may survive low- to moderate-severity fire without top-kill
    - younger trees have relatively thin barks that make them more vulnerable to fire damage
    - fire creates disturbed areas that may be colonized by wind- or water-dispersed seedlings
  - herbivory/microbial defense:
    - high terpene and phenolic resin content in buds reduces cellulose digestion, rendering the tissue less palatable to herbivores and less inviting to fungi and bacteria
    - resin transferred to leaves as they emerge from the buds provides extended protection
    - resin later produced by glands at leaf edges
