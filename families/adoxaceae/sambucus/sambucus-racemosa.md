Relevant info:
  - wood used to make flutes and small instruments
  - ethnobotanically important to many native tribes across North America
  - Native Americans used fruits as food and extracts from the roots and/or bark for medicinal purposes
  - another native species, *S. cerulea* (blue elderberry), has 5--9 leaflets, flat-topped clusters of flowers, and whitish-blue fruit

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - widely distributed throughout much of Washington
  - ranging throughout North America, except the southern States
  - found in stream banks, swampy thickets, moist clearings and open forests from sea level to middle elevations
  - pollinated by bees, flies, and wind
  - seed dispersal -- despite toxins that are problematic for ruminants, such as deer, the fruits are eaten by birds, eastern fox squirrels, white-footed mice, northern raccoons, American black bears, brown bears, and grizzly bears, which aids in seed dispersal
  - vegetative reproduction:
    - spreads by rhizomes and root suckers to form colonies
    - sprouts from the root crown and/or rhizomes after top-kill by fire.
  - herbivore defense:
    - stems, bark, leaves and roots contain cyanide-producing glycosides
    - cyanide is toxic to animals because it prevents hemoglobin from releasing its oxygen to tissues
  - fire-adapted:
    - fire can crack red elderberry's hard seed coat, aiding germination
    - perennating buds on root crown are protected by mineral soil
  - adapted to wetlands -- lenticels (pores in stems) and hollow stems enable oxygen to be transported from the air to roots/rhizomes below ground
  - succession:
    - establish best on open, disturbed sites
    - commonly establishes in canopy gaps within mature forests
    - tolerates shade, so may persist in late-seral post-fire stages
  - wildlife:
    - birds and mammals eat berries
    - fly species consume pollen
    - porcupines, mice and snowshoe hares consume buds and bark in winter
    - elk, deer, mountain goats, and bears browse leaves and branches
    - shrubfields provide habitat for grizzly bears
    - passerines and other birds build nests and perch
    - on streambanks, provide shade cover for fish
