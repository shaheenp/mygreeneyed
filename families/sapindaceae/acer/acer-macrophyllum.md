Other characteristics:
  - tree to 90 ft.
  - trunk usually split within 10 ft of ground
  - branches of mature trees are massive, spreading, and steeply inclined at the tips
  - deciduous
  - flowers before leaves
  - petioles have milky sap if split
  - young bark green and smooth
  - older bark grayish/reddish brown, interlacing ridges & furrows, often covered with mosses, lichens and small ferns.

Relevant info:
  - lives 50-200 years
  - largest maple species in North America, producing largest maple leaves in N. America
  - most common Seattle tree
  - called "paddle tree" in many First Nation languages because wood was used to make canoe paddles, among other implements

Ecology & Adaptations:
  - native from Alaska south to northern California
  - in Washington, both sides of the Cascades
  - found in dry to moist soils, often with Douglas fir (*[Pseudotsuga menziesii]({{ "/pinaceae/pseudotsuga/pseudotsuga-menziesii/" | relative_url }})*)
  - often on sites disturbed by fire or logging
  - moist woods from sea level to mid-elevations in the mountains
  - epiphytes (surface plants):
    - hosts more communities (by mass) of moss/lichen/ liverwort/fern than any other species in PNW
    - licorice fern (*Polypodium glysyrrhiza*), with licorice-flavored rhizome, is common epiphyte
    - epiphytes can form canopy soils into which the tree produces "canopy roots" (first discovered by graduate student who liked to climb trees!)
  - pollination:
    - by insects including bees, flies, and beetles
    - trees resume growth early in spring and flowers bloom before or with leave emergence, which creates competitive advantage for attracting pollinators
  - sexual reproduction:
    - heterodichogamous
    - within and among populations, trees may produce female flowers before male flowers (protogynous) or male before female (protandrous)
    - mating system facilitates outcrossing and genetic diversity
  - seed dispersal:
    - 'wings' aid dispersal by wind
    - seedlings survive only if taproots reach moist soil before the dry season
  - vegetative regeneration -- re-sprouts from adventitious buds in root crown or stump after fire, cutting, or other disturbance
  - tolerates flooding:
    - short-term but not long-term (>2 months) in riparian zones, in both lower and upper stream terraces
    - re-sprouts
    - large woody material is important part of floodplain log jams
  - moderately shade tolerant, but photosynthesis is more efficient in full sun or edge conditions
  - usually pioneer species establishing in open areas created by disturbance
  - fire tolerant:
    - readily re-sprouts following topkill
    - thick bark on large, mature trees provides protection from fires of moderate severity
    - off-site trees may provide seed dispersed by wind
  - tolerates wind -- deep taproot
  - succession:
    - in riparian communities, bigleaf maple often follows red alder (*[Alnus rubra]({{ "/betulaceae/alnus/alnus-rubra/" | relative_url }})*) and willows (*[Salix]({{ "/salicaceae/salix/" | relative_url }})*)
    - turnover rate from red alder to bigleaf maple and black cottonwood (*[Populus trichocarpa]({{ "/salicaceae/populus/populus-trichocarpa/" | relative_url }})*) dominance ranges from 60 to 80 years
    - bigleaf maple and Sitka spruce (*Picea sitchensis*) may remain codominant "for centuries" before Sitka spruce overtops the hardwoods
    - on upland sites, maple may replace Pacific madrone (*[Arbutus menziesii]({{ "/ericaceae/arbutus/arbutus-menziesii/" | relative_url }})*) and oaks (*[Quercus]({{ "/fagaceae/quercus/" | relative_url }})*)
  - wildlife:
    - many species use bigleaf maple for food (mule deer, mountain beaver, rodents, invertebrates) and cover (mule deer, elk, creeping voles, Townsend's chipmunks, western redbacked salamanders, and Pacific giant salamanders)
    - seeds are eaten by Douglas's squirrels, northern flying squirrels, deer mice, finches, and evening grosbeaks eat the seeds
    - harlequin ducks and pileated woodpeckers nest in these trees
    - honeybees and other insects feed on the nectar
